<guid>title:anthropic and infosys collaborate to build ai agents for telecommunications and other regulated industries</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 08:59:40 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Anthropic and Infosys , a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting founded and headquartered in Bengaluru, today announced a collaboration to develop and deliver enterprise AI solutions across telecommunications, financial services, manufacturing, and software development. The collaboration integrates Anthropic’s Claude models and Claude Code with Infosys Topaz , an AI-first set of services, solutions, and platforms using generative and agentic AI technologies, to help companies speed up software development and adopt AI with the governance and transparency that regulated industries require. India is the second-largest market for Claude.ai, home to a developer community doing some of the most technically intense AI work we see anywhere: nearly half of Claude usage in India involves building applications, modernizing systems, and shipping production software. Infosys is one of the first partners in Anthropic’s expanded presence in India .</description>

<description>India is the second-largest market for Claude. ai , home to a developer community doing some of the most technically intense AI work we see anywhere. Nearly half of Claude usage in India comprises computer and mathematical tasks: building applications, modernizing systems, and shipping production software. Today, as we officially open our Bengaluru office, we’re announcing partnerships across enterprise, education, and agriculture that deepen our commitment to India across a range of sectors. “India represents one of the world’s most promising opportunities to bring the benefits of responsible AI to vastly more people and enterprises,” said Irina Ghose, Managing Director of India, Anthropic. “Already, it’s home to extraordinary technical talent, digital infrastructure at scale, and a proven track record of using technology to improve people’s lives.</description>

<title>Introducing Claude Opus 4.6</title>
<link>https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6</link>
<guid>title:introducing claude opus 4 6</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 08:59:38 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We’re upgrading our smartest model. The new Claude Opus 4. 6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4. 6 features a 1M token context window in beta 1 .</description>

<description>Sonnet 4. 6 delivers frontier performance across coding, agents, and professional work at scale. We’re upgrading our smartest model. Across agentic coding, computer use, tool use, search, and finance, Opus 4. 6 is an industry-leading model, often by wide margin. We’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free.</description>

<title>Anthropic and the Government of Rwanda sign MOU for AI in health and education</title>

<guid>title:anthropic and the government of rwanda sign mou for ai in health and education</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 08:59:40 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The Government of Rwanda and Anthropic have signed a three-year Memorandum of Understanding to formalize and expand our partnership, bringing AI to Rwanda’s education, health, and public sector systems. This agreement builds on the ALX education partnership we announced in November 2025 and marks the first time Anthropic has formalized a multi-sector partnership through a government MOU on the African continent. Our collaboration spans three areas: “This partnership with Anthropic is an important milestone in Rwanda’s AI journey. Our goal is to continue to design and deploy AI solutions that can be applied at a national level to strengthen education, advance health outcomes, and enhance governance with an emphasis on our context,” said Paula Ingabire, Minister of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Innovation in Rwanda.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<title>Will reward-seekers respond to distant incentives?</title>

<guid>title:will reward seekers respond to distant incentives</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 19:35:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 16, 2026 7:35 PM GMT Reward-seekers are usually modeled as responding only to local incentives administered by developers. Here I ask: Will AIs or humans be able to influence their incentives at a distance—e. g. , by retroactively reinforcing actions substantially in the future or by committing to run many copies of them in simulated deployments with different incentives? If reward-seekers are responsive to distant incentives, it fundamentally changes the threat model, and is probably bad news for developers on balance. The core problem is asymmetric control: developers can relatively [1] tightly control local incentives—the reward signal during training and deployment—but they can't prevent distant actors from offering competing incentives.</description>

<description>I come from a DevOps and blockchain background. I've spent years managing infrastructure, wrangling containers, and thinking about how systems should be architected. So when I started shipping web apps and saw what developers were paying for deployment platforms, something felt off. Vercel's DX is incredible — I won't pretend otherwise. git push and your app is live. But then you look at the bill: $20/seat/month.</description>

<description>Software Engineering 2026: The Complete Guide to AI Survival By early 2026, 41% of all production code is generated by AI agents. Meanwhile, junior developer job postings have plummeted by 40% compared to 2022. It feels like the end of an era. But is the human coder actually extinct? Or are we standing at the edge of the most high-leverage period in software history? For those of us in the trenches of engineering and product management, the landscape has shifted beneath our feet.</description>

<description>With the advent of AI, we all know how lazy mostly engineers have become to just vibecode half of the time and trust me it has rather improved efficiency in the corporate world. Thus, making employees feel like they shot themselves in the foot. But anyways we are in a constant cycle of evolution, so this is just a step for us engineers to become lazier and lazier, like who's going to keep revising syntax over and over again, right? When I know what I want to do let my chores be handled by AI. I vibecode half my day away. Honestly?</description>

<title>AXRP Episode 48 - Guive Assadi on AI Property Rights</title>

<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 15, 2026 2:20 AM GMT YouTube link In this episode, Guive Assadi argues that we should give AIs property rights, so that they are integrated in our system of property and come to rely on it. The claim is that this means that AIs would not kill or steal from humans, because that would undermine the whole property system, which would be extremely valuable to them. Topics we discuss: AI property rights Why not steal from and kill humans Why AIs may fear it could be them next AI retirement Could humans be upgraded to stay useful? Will AI progress continue? Why non-obsoletable AIs may still not end human property rights Why make AIs with property rights? Do property rights incentivize alignment?</description>

<description>100K GitHub stars. Thousands of exposed servers. A $16M crypto scam. The age of autonomous AI agents is here — and nobody is ready. In January 2026, a weekend project by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger broke the internet. OpenClaw (originally called Clawdbot) — a self-hosted AI agent that lives in your WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack — racked up 9,000 GitHub stars in 24 hours and crossed 100,000 in under two months.</description>

<description>AI’s Diminishing Returns: Avoiding the Overreliance Trap “I find it hard to see, how there can be a good return on investment given, the current math. ” This warning about AI infrastructure economics is not just for tech investors, but it has a direct bearing on banking and financial services, where the current wave of AI adoption risks building systemic fragility under the banner of innovation. Unlike earlier generation of AI solutions, which were often developed in-house, fine-tuned on proprietary datasets, and deployed within the secure boundaries of a bank’s own infrastructure, today’s wave of general-purpose AI is of a very different breed. At the centre of this shift are large language models ( LLMs) and similar foundation models, which are not built or run locally but unleashed at scale through centralised data centres and software stacks maintained by a handful of technology providers. Every solution built on such infrastructure, be it a chatbot, a fraud detection engine, or a compliance tool, ultimately depends on continuous calls to these central data centres. The implication is that future pricing models will inevitably evolve toward a per-transaction basis, much like how the industry already prices microservices and API-based services.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 08:59:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<description>Eye-catching martial arts performance at China gala had viewers and experts wondering what else humanoids can do Dancing humanoid robots took centre stage on Monday during the annual China Media Group’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s most-watched official television broadcast. They lunged and backflipped (landing on their knees), they spun around and jumped. Not one fell over. The display was impressive, but prompted some to wonder: if robots can now dance and perform martial arts, what else can they do? Continue reading...</description>
