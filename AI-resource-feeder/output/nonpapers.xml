<title>Anthropic acquires Vercept to advance Claude's computer use capabilities</title>

<guid>title:anthropic acquires vercept to advance claude s computer use capabilities</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:34 +0000</pubDate>
<description>People are using Claude for increasingly complex work—writing and running code across entire repositories, synthesizing research from dozens of sources, and managing workflows that span multiple tools and teams. Computer use enables Claude to do all of that inside live applications, the way a person at a keyboard would. That means Claude can take on multi-step tasks in live applications, and solve problems impossible with code alone. Today, we're announcing that Anthropic has acquired Vercept to help us push those capabilities further. Vercept was built around a clear thesis: making AI genuinely useful for completing complex tasks requires solving hard perception and interaction problems. The Vercept team—including co-founders Kiana Ehsani, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick—have spent years thinking carefully about how AI systems can see and act within the same software humans use every day.</description>

<title>Statement on the comments from Secretary of War Pete Hegseth</title>

<guid>title:statement on the comments from secretary of war pete hegseth</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Earlier today, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth shared on X that he is directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a supply chain risk. This action follows months of negotiations that reached an impasse over two exceptions we requested to the lawful use of our AI model, Claude: the mass domestic surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons. We have not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations. We have tried in good faith to reach an agreement with the Department of War, making clear that we support all lawful uses of AI for national security aside from the two narrow exceptions above. To the best of our knowledge, these exceptions have not affected a single government mission to date.</description>

<title>Detecting and preventing distillation attacks</title>

<guid>title:detecting and preventing distillation attacks</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:41 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We have identified industrial-scale campaigns by three AI laboratories—DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax—to illicitly extract Claude’s capabilities to improve their own models. These labs generated over 16 million exchanges with Claude through approximately 24,000 fraudulent accounts, in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions. These labs used a technique called “distillation,” which involves training a less capable model on the outputs of a stronger one. Distillation is a widely used and legitimate training method. For example, frontier AI labs routinely distill their own models to create smaller, cheaper versions for their customers. But distillation can also be used for illicit purposes: competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently.</description>

<title>Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policy: Version 3.0</title>
<link>https://www.anthropic.com/news/responsible-scaling-policy-v3</link>
<guid>title:anthropic s responsible scaling policy version 3 0</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:38 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We’re releasing the third version of our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), the voluntary framework we use to mitigate catastrophic risks from AI systems. Anthropic has now had an RSP for more than two years, and we’ve learned a great deal about its benefits and its shortcomings. We’re therefore updating the policy to reinforce what has worked well to date, improve the policy where necessary, and implement new measures to increase the transparency and accountability of our decision-making. You can read the new RSP in full here . In this post, we’ll discuss some of the thinking behind the changes.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<title>Statement from Dario Amodei on our discussions with the Department of War</title>
<link>https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war</link>
<guid>title:statement from dario amodei on our discussions with the department of war</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:32 +0000</pubDate>
<description>I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community. We were the first frontier AI company to deploy our models in the US government’s classified networks, the first to deploy them at the National Laboratories , and the first to provide custom models for national security customers. Claude is extensively deployed across the Department of War and other national security agencies for mission-critical applications, such as intelligence analysis, modeling and simulation, operational planning, cyber operations, and more. Anthropic has also acted to defend America’s lead in AI, even when it is against the company’s short-term interest. We chose to forgo several hundred million dollars in revenue to cut off the use of Claude by firms linked to the Chinese Communist Party (some of whom have been designated by the Department of War as Chinese Military Companies), shut down CCP-sponsored cyberattacks that attempted to abuse Claude, and have advocated for strong export controls on chips to ensure a democratic advantage.</description>

<title>Schelling Goodness, and Shared Morality as a Goal</title>

<pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 04:25:42 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Also available in markdown at theMultiplicity. ai/blog/schelling-goodness . This post explores a notion I'll call Schelling goodness . Claims of Schelling goodness are not first-order moral verdicts like &quot;X is good&quot; or &quot;X is bad. &quot; They are claims about a class of hypothetical coordination games in the sense of Thomas Schelling, where the task being coordinated on is a moral verdict. In each such game, participants aim to give the same response regarding a moral question, by reasoning about what a very diverse population of intelligent beings would converge on, using only broadly shared constraints: common knowledge of the question at hand, and background knowledge from the survival and growth pressures that shape successful civilizations.</description>

<description>🧵 I chased a phantom through two config files, three API keys, and 47 SSH sessions. The fix was one line of JSON. 🤖 What's OpenClaw? Before I dive in — if you haven't heard of OpenClaw , it's an open-source AI agent framework that lets you run persistent AI assistants on your own server. Think of it as your self-hosted ChatGPT, but with memory, personality, tools, scheduled tasks, and multi-channel support (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, etc. ).</description>

<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Basic chunking gets you a demo. Hybrid search, reranking with the Vertex AI Ranking API, metadata filtering, and tuned retrieval configs turn a RAG Engine corpus into a production system. All wired through Terraform and the Python SDK. In RAG Post 1 , we deployed a Vertex AI RAG Engine corpus with basic fixed-size chunking. It works, but retrieval quality is mediocre. Your users ask nuanced questions and get incomplete or irrelevant answers back.</description>

<pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 03:20:21 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Authors: Aditya Singh*, Gerson Kroiz*, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda Aditya and Gerson are co-first authors. This work was conducted during MATS 9. 0 and was advised by Senthooran Rajamanoharan and Neel Nanda. Motivation Imagine that a frontier lab’s coding agent has been caught putting a bug in the key code for monitoring what that agent does. Naively, this seems like a clear smoking gun that the agent is scheming. But LLMs often do weird things; they could easily just be confused, or have made a mistake.</description>

<description>Agentic Engineering Patterns &amp;gt; When we lose track of how code written by our agents works we take on cognitive debt . For a lot of things this doesn't matter: if the code fetches some data from a database and outputs it as JSON the implementation details are likely simple enough that we don't need to care. We can try out the new feature and make a very solid guess at how it works, then glance over the code to be sure. Often though the details really do matter. If the core of our application becomes a black box that we don't fully understand we can no longer confidently reason about it, which makes planning new features harder and eventually slows our progress in the same way that accumulated technical debt does. How do we pay down cognitive debt?</description>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:23 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

The constraint: zero dependencies, one script tag, works anywhere. Six widgets later, here's what actually surprised me. 1. WhatsApp Floating Button The widget: A floating button that opens a WhatsApp chat with a pre-filled message. Optional popup card with agent name, avatar, and online indicator.</description>

<description>Image Generate by ChatGPT The role of embeddings in how LLMs turn your words into numbers, and why those numbers capture meaning. Large language models do not read words. They read numbers. Every word, every sentence, every paragraph that flows through a model like GPT-5 or LLaMA is first converted into a dense numerical representation called an embedding. That conversion is not a formality. It is where meaning begins.</description>

<description>In 2025, if you walked into any AI conference, you may hear the same gospel: faster inference, longer context windows, cheaper inference costs. It's as if we've spent years perfecting the hammer, making it lighter, stronger, more precisely balanced, while never questioning the fact that the carpenter still has only two hands and twenty-four hours in a day. Now, Kimi introduces Agent Swarm. It is not a better hammer. It is a reconstruction of the entire workshop.</description>

<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:26 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Have you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so? Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability.</description>

<description>The Economic Research team studies how AI is reshaping the economy, including work, productivity, and economic opportunity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, we track AI's real-world economic effects and publish research that helps policymakers, businesses, and the public understand and prepare for the changes ahead. We build the empirical foundation for understanding AI's economic impact. Our flagship Anthropic Economic Index tracks how AI tools are actually being used around the world and across every sector of the economy—moving beyond speculation to measure adoption patterns as they unfold. Alongside our index reports, we produce novel research that studies the implications of AI usage and diffusion—as tracked in the index—for workers, for firms, and for the broader economy. Economic transitions create both opportunity and disruption.</description>

<description>Future AI systems will be even more powerful than today’s, likely in ways that break key assumptions behind current safety techniques. That’s why it’s important to develop sophisticated safeguards to ensure models remain helpful, honest, and harmless. The Alignment team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely. Alignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own. Alignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.</description>
