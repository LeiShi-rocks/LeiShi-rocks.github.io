<description>AI will bring enormous benefits —for science, technology, medicine, economic growth, and much more. But a technology this powerful also comes with considerable risks . Those risks might come from the misuse of the models: AI is already being exploited to automate cyberattacks ; in the future it might assist in the production of dangerous weapons . Risks might also come from the models themselves: powerful AI systems can take harmful actions contrary to the intentions—and out of the control—of their users. AI models are improving in their capabilities at a dizzying, increasing pace , from simple chatbots in 2023 to today’s “agents” that complete complex tasks. At Anthropic, we’ve had to redesign a notoriously difficult technical test for hiring software engineers multiple times as successive AI models defeated each version.</description>

<title>Anthropic partners with CodePath to bring Claude to the US’s largest collegiate computer science program</title>

<guid>title:anthropic partners with codepath to bring claude to the us s largest collegiate computer science program</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 08:46:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Anthropic is partnering with CodePath, the nation’s largest provider of collegiate computer science education, to redesign its coding curriculum as AI reshapes the field of software development. CodePath will put Claude and Claude Code at the center of its courses and career programs, giving more than 20,000 students at community colleges, state schools, and HBCUs access to frontier AI tools as part of their education. Over 40% of CodePath students come from families earning under $50,000 a year, and CodePath aims to provide them with industry-vetted courses and access to career networks traditionally reserved for students at wealthier institutions. CodePath is integrating Claude into its AI courses—including Foundations of AI Engineering, Applications of AI Engineering, and AI Open-Source Capstone—so students can learn to build with tools like Claude Code and contribute to real-world open-source projects.</description>

<title>Introducing Claude Opus 4.6</title>

<guid>title:introducing claude opus 4 6</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 08:46:05 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We’re upgrading our smartest model. The new Claude Opus 4. 6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4. 6 features a 1M token context window in beta 1 .</description>

<description>We’re upgrading our smartest model. Across agentic coding, computer use, tool use, search, and finance, Opus 4. 6 is an industry-leading model, often by wide margin. We have raised $30 billion in Series G funding led by GIC and Coatue, valuing Anthropic at $380 billion post-money. The investment will fuel the frontier research, product development, and infrastructure expansions that have made Anthropic the market leader in enterprise AI and coding. Our run-rate revenue is $14 billion, with this figure growing over 10x annually in each of those past three years.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<description>Let’s be honest — Large Language Models (LLMs) are incredibly smart… until they aren’t. To know the fundamentals of transformers architecture, read my deep dive blog on it from here . They can explain quantum physics or write code, but sometimes they confidently make things up. Not because they want to lie, but because they’re trained to predict language, not verify facts. If you’ve read my previous post on hallucinations, you know how easily an AI can sound correct while being completely wrong. And that’s exactly where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enters the story.</description>

<description>How to Train a Language Model on Your Resume (and Why You Shouldn’t) Super cool AI generated image of a resume transforming into an LLM Introduction It’s no mystery that the STEM job market is a bit hectic right now. But, it still makes us question whether the struggle is the market or is it us? Maybe I’m not conveying my strengths well enough to employers? What could be a solution to this? One solution I had was to add a Small Language Model (SLM) chatbot to my personal website (don’t judge it. Even now, it’s probably not done).</description>

<description>TL;DR: If your LLM app “mostly works” in production, you might already be paying hidden costs in latency, cloud bills, and user trust. Before tuning your prompt one more time, run this 30-minute audit. This is a developer-focused companion to the original article on whether you need an LLM audit. If you want broader context on how GenAI-specific audit differs from general AI system audit , check out this companion piece: https://optyxstack. com/llm-audit/genai-audit-vs-ai-system-audit The Real Problem: “Mostly Works” in Production In early demos, everything looks fine.

<description>This is a submission for the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge What I Built What if GitHub Copilot could teach you to code, not just code for you? Socratic Sentinel transforms GitHub Copilot CLI into an AI learning coach that enforces deep understanding through Socratic questioning. Instead of handing you solutions, it guides you there — combating the &quot;competence collapse&quot; developers are discussing across Reddit, Hacker News, and X in 2026. It’s a custom Copilot agent built with official Agent Client Protocol (ACP) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) that intercepts queries in real-time and responds with targeted questions (e. g. , &quot;What's the key invariant in binary search?</description>

<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 08:18:16 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Most Laravel developers hit the same wall when integrating Claude: the official docs focus on JavaScript, most community guides assume Python, and Laravel tutorials stop at toy chatbots that break under real load. This guide shows how Claude fits into a production Laravel 11 codebase—how to structure the integration cleanly and why certain decisions matter once AI becomes a dependency instead of an experiment. We’ll build in layers. Each part expands the system, explains why a pattern exists, and walks through the code. By the end, you’ll understand not just how to call Claude, but how to reason about AI integration the same way you reason about databases, queues, and external services. Stack: Laravel 11, Claude Messages API, raw HTTP (no SDK).</description>

<description>Your AI chatbot's &quot;memory&quot; isn't magic—it's your database architecture. And choosing wrong costs enterprises millions in latency, scaling failures, and missed retrieval accuracy. Ever wonder how your AI chatbot seems to &quot;remember&quot; facts or search your documents? It's not magic - it's the database. Today's AI-powered apps (from customer support bots to coding assistants) need to fetch information by meaning , not just exact matches. This has sparked a seismic shift in the database world.</description>

<title>Project Vend: Phase two</title>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 08:45:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<description>Published on February 12, 2026 7:38 PM GMT 1. Summary and overview LLMs seem to lack metacognitive skills that help humans catch errors. Improvements to those skills might be net positive for alignment, despite improving capabilities in new directions. Better metacognition would reduce LLM errors by catching mistakes, and by managing complex cognition to produce better answers in the first place. This could stabilize or regularize alignment, allowing systems to avoid actions they would not &quot;endorse on reflection&quot; (in some functional sense). [1] Better metacognition could also make LLM systems useful for clarifying the conceptual problems of alignment.</description>

<title>How do we (more) safely defer to AIs?</title>

<guid>title:how do we more safely defer to ais</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:55:52 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 12, 2026 4:55 PM GMT As AI systems get more capable, it becomes increasingly uncompetitive and infeasible to avoid deferring to AIs on increasingly many decisions. Further, once systems are sufficiently capable, control becomes infeasible . [1] Thus, one of the main strategies for handling AI risk is fully (or almost fully) deferring to AIs on managing these risks. Broadly speaking, when I say &quot;deferring to AIs&quot; [2] I mean having these AIs do virtually all of the work to develop more capable and aligned successor AIs, managing exogenous risks, and making strategic decisions. [3] If we plan to defer to AIs, I think it's safest to do so only a bit above the minimum level of qualitative capability/intelligence required to automate safety research, implementation, and strategy. [4] For deference to go well, we both need it to be the case that the AIs we defer to aren't scheming against us and that they are sufficiently aligned and effective on key tasks (aligning the next generation of AIs, buying more time to work on alignment, making good strategic decisions).</description>

<title>How Generative and Agentic AI Shift Concern from Technical Debt to Cognitive Debt</title>

<guid>title:how generative and agentic ai shift concern from technical debt to cognitive debt</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 05:20:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>How Generative and Agentic AI Shift Concern from Technical Debt to Cognitive Debt This piece by Margaret-Anne Storey is the best explanation of the term cognitive debt I've seen so far. Cognitive debt , a term gaining traction recently, instead communicates the notion that the debt compounded from going fast lives in the brains of the developers and affects their lived experiences and abilities to “go fast” or to make changes. Even if AI agents produce code that could be easy to understand, the humans involved may have simply lost the plot and may not understand what the program is supposed to do, how their intentions were implemented, or how to possibly change it. Margaret-Anne expands on this further with an anecdote about a student team she coached: But by weeks 7 or 8, one team hit a wall. They could no longer make even simple changes without breaking something unexpected. When I met with them, the team initially blamed technical debt: messy code, poor architecture, hurried implementations.</description>

<description>A guide to enhancing vector-based Search and Recommendations using Multimodal AI and Filtered KNN Image by the author — Generated with ChatGPT. I recently published a story describing how to build an image-based recommendation system and search engine using the ResNet model as an embedding model, and Elasticsearch as a vector database . While the recommendation system performs well overall, we found that some recommended items do not belong to the same category as the query item. To address this, we used Elasticsearch’s filtered KNN to improve recommendation relevance. We observed a similar issue in the search engine results, as illustrated in the image below. The goal of this story is to address this limitation by first applying a classification model to identify the query image's category and then using that category to perform a filtered KNN search in Elasticsearch.</description>

<title>From LLMs to Agents: Generalizability from the Inside Out</title>

<guid>title:from llms to agents generalizability from the inside out</guid>
<pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:41:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Achieving a powerful synergy in human-AI collaboration requires extreme versatility in agent capabilities, both at the level of generalization across modalities, languages, tasks, and domains in its own reasoning and problem solving, as well as in its role-taking and interactive strategy enactment in collaboration. This talk first explores model generalization from the inside out, building on insights into the complementary affordances of disparate data sources as they are transformed through a learning process, and then turning outwards to application across five tasks, including event ordering, question answering, form understanding, multi-lingual relation extraction, and reasoning path prediction. The concept of learning from contrasting cases is demonstrated to facilitate easy-to-hard generalization by fostering more nuanced instruction following skills. The concept of scaffolding is also used to illustrate how representations of reasoning may extend model capabilities beyond a natural frontier, either through augmentations injected into the learning process or as part of inference-time interaction with a human or agent partner or with the environment. Extending 3 decades of research into AI-supported collaborative work, the talk ends with a discussion about work-in-progress extending model generalization research into an agentic setting where intelligent collaborative agents participate in collaboration with another agent, a human collaborator, or a group of humans.

<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 08:46:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Have you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so? Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability.</description>

<description>The Economic Research team studies how AI is reshaping the economy, including work, productivity, and economic opportunity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, we track AI's real-world economic effects and publish research that helps policymakers, businesses, and the public understand and prepare for the changes ahead. We build the empirical foundation for understanding AI's economic impact. Our flagship Anthropic Economic Index tracks how AI tools are actually being used around the world and across every sector of the economy—moving beyond speculation to measure adoption patterns as they unfold. Alongside our index reports, we produce novel research that studies the implications of AI usage and diffusion—as tracked in the index—for workers, for firms, and for the broader economy. Economic transitions create both opportunity and disruption.</description>

<description>Future AI systems will be even more powerful than today’s, likely in ways that break key assumptions behind current safety techniques. That’s why it’s important to develop sophisticated safeguards to ensure models remain helpful, honest, and harmless. The Alignment team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely. Alignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own. Alignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.</description>

<description>Our research teams investigate the safety, inner workings, and societal impacts of AI models – so that artificial intelligence has a positive impact as it becomes increasingly capable. The mission of the Interpretability team is to discover and understand how large language models work internally, as a foundation for AI safety and positive outcomes. The Alignment team works to understand the risks of AI models and develop ways to ensure that future ones remain helpful, honest, and harmless.</description>
