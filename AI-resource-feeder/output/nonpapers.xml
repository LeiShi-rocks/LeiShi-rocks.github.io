<guid>title:anthropic and infosys collaborate to build ai agents for telecommunications and other regulated industries</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 09:00:49 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Anthropic and Infosys , a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting founded and headquartered in Bengaluru, today announced a collaboration to develop and deliver enterprise AI solutions across telecommunications, financial services, manufacturing, and software development. The collaboration integrates Anthropic's Claude models and Claude Code with Infosys Topaz , an AI-first set of services, solutions, and platforms using generative and agentic AI technologies, to help companies speed up software development and adopt AI with the governance and transparency that regulated industries require. India is the second-largest market for Claude.ai, home to a developer community doing some of the most technically intense AI work we see anywhere — nearly half of Claude usage in India involves building applications, modernizing systems, and shipping production software. Infosys is one of the first partners in Anthropic's expanded presence in India .</description>

<guid>title:anthropic partners with codepath to bring claude to the us s largest collegiate computer science program</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 09:00:58 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Anthropic is partnering with CodePath, the nation’s largest provider of collegiate computer science education, to redesign its coding curriculum as AI reshapes the field of software development. CodePath will put Claude and Claude Code at the center of its courses and career programs, giving more than 20,000 students at community colleges, state schools, and HBCUs access to frontier AI tools as part of their education. Over 40% of CodePath students come from families earning under $50,000 a year, and CodePath aims to provide them with industry-vetted courses and access to career networks traditionally reserved for students at wealthier institutions. CodePath is integrating Claude into its AI courses—including Foundations of AI Engineering, Applications of AI Engineering, and AI Open-Source Capstone—so students can learn to build with tools like Claude Code and contribute to real-world open-source projects.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 09:00:54 +0000</pubDate>
<description>India is the second-largest market for Claude. ai , home to a developer community doing some of the most technically intense AI work we see anywhere. Nearly half of Claude usage in India comprises computer and mathematical tasks: building applications, modernizing systems, and shipping production software. Today, as we officially open our Bengaluru office, we’re announcing partnerships across enterprise, education, and agriculture that deepen our commitment to India across a range of sectors. “India represents one of the world’s most promising opportunities to bring the benefits of responsible AI to vastly more people and enterprises,” said Irina Ghose, Managing Director of India, Anthropic. “Already, it’s home to extraordinary technical talent, digital infrastructure at scale, and a proven track record of using technology to improve people’s lives.</description>

<guid>title:introducing claude opus 4 6</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 09:00:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We’re upgrading our smartest model. The new Claude Opus 4. 6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4. 6 features a 1M token context window in beta 1 .</description>

<description>We’re upgrading our smartest model. Across agentic coding, computer use, tool use, search, and finance, Opus 4. 6 is an industry-leading model, often by wide margin. We have raised $30 billion in Series G funding led by GIC and Coatue, valuing Anthropic at $380 billion post-money. The investment will fuel the frontier research, product development, and infrastructure expansions that have made Anthropic the market leader in enterprise AI and coding. Our run-rate revenue is $14 billion, with this figure growing over 10x annually in each of those past three years.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<title>Will reward-seekers respond to distant incentives?</title>
<link>https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/8cyjgrTSxGNdghesE/will-reward-seekers-respond-to-distant-incentives</link>
<guid>title:will reward seekers respond to distant incentives</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 19:35:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 16, 2026 7:35 PM GMT Reward-seekers are usually modeled as responding only to local incentives administered by developers. Here I ask: Will AIs or humans be able to influence their incentives at a distance—e. g. , by retroactively reinforcing actions substantially in the future or by committing to run many copies of them in simulated deployments with different incentives? If reward-seekers are responsive to distant incentives, it fundamentally changes the threat model, and is probably bad news for developers on balance. The core problem is asymmetric control: developers can relatively [1] tightly control local incentives—the reward signal during training and deployment—but they can't prevent distant actors from offering competing incentives.</description>

<title>AXRP Episode 48 - Guive Assadi on AI Property Rights</title>

<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 15, 2026 2:20 AM GMT YouTube link In this episode, Guive Assadi argues that we should give AIs property rights, so that they are integrated in our system of property and come to rely on it. The claim is that this means that AIs would not kill or steal from humans, because that would undermine the whole property system, which would be extremely valuable to them. Topics we discuss: AI property rights Why not steal from and kill humans Why AIs may fear it could be them next AI retirement Could humans be upgraded to stay useful? Will AI progress continue? Why non-obsoletable AIs may still not end human property rights Why make AIs with property rights? Do property rights incentivize alignment?</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 08:47:16 +0000</pubDate>
<description>While building small AI utilities, I kept running into the same problem: agent frameworks felt heavy ad-hoc tool calling became messy workflows quickly turned into glue code I wanted something in between. So I built Kimten — a minimal micro-agent loop on top of the Vercel AI SDK. What Kimten is Kimten is a thin wrapper over the AI SDK Agent interface that gives you: a bounded agent loop (no infinite reasoning spirals) tool/function calling short-term conversation memory optional structured output via Zod predictable, minimal behavior No planners. No orchestration. No runtime magic. It’s meant to feel like a smart helper, not a framework.</description>

<title>Building Production-Ready RAG Systems with Free LLMs: From Zero to Analysis-Ready in 6 Steps</title>
<link>https://pub.towardsai.net/building-production-ready-rag-systems-with-free-llms-from-zero-to-analysis-ready-in-6-steps-9c4d215c619b?source=rss----98111c9905da---4</link>
<guid>title:building production ready rag systems with free llms from zero to analysis ready in 6 steps</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 04:51:47 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Introduction When I started exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for incident analysis, I realized that jumping straight into paid APIs like Claude or OpenAI wasn’t practical for learning and experimentation. Instead, I wanted to build something completely local , free to run , and powerful enough to handle real production scenarios . This article documents my journey building a fully functional RAG system that analyzes production incidents by learning from past issues — without spending a dime on API calls. Everything runs on a laptop using open-source tools. What You’ll Build By the end of this guide, you’ll understand how to build a working RAG system that: ✅ Learns from past incident data (your knowledge base) ✅ Performs semantic search on incident history (finds similar past issues) ✅ Analyzes new incidents using an open-source LLM (Llama 2) ✅ Suggests root causes and resolutions based on historical patterns ✅ Runs completely locally (no API keys, no cloud services) ✅ Produces analysis in 8–15 seconds per incident Real-World Use Case Imagine you have a production incident: New Issue: - Memory usage: 89% (baseline: 45%) - GC pause time: 2. 3 seconds (SLA: 200ms) - Cache lookups: 4x slower than normal - Error: OutOfMemoryError starting to appear Your RAG system will: Search through historical incidents Find that on January 15th, you had a similar issue (85% match) Retrieve the resolution that worked then (LRU cache eviction policy) Analyze the current incident with that context Provide a confidence-based recommendation That’s the power of RAG with local LLMs.</description>

<title>Two new Showboat tools: Chartroom and datasette-showboat</title>
<link>https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/17/chartroom-and-datasette-showboat/#atom-everything</link>
<guid>title:two new showboat tools chartroom and datasette showboat</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 00:43:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>I introduced Showboat a week ago - my CLI tool that helps coding agents create Markdown documents that demonstrate the code that they have created. I've been finding new ways to use it on a daily basis, and I've just released two new tools to help get the best out of the Showboat pattern. Chartroom is a CLI charting tool that works well with Showboat, and datasette-showboat lets Showboat's new remote publishing feature incrementally push documents to a Datasette instance. Showboat remote publishing datasette-showboat Chartroom How I built Chartroom The burgeoning Showboat ecosystem Showboat remote publishing I normally use Showboat in Claude Code for web (see note from this morning ). I've used it in several different projects in the past few days, each of them with a prompt that looks something like this: Use &quot;uvx showboat --help&quot; to perform a very thorough investigation of what happens if you use the Python sqlite-chronicle and sqlite-history-json libraries against the same SQLite database table Here's the resulting document . Just telling Claude Code to run uvx showboat --help is enough for it to learn how to use the tool - the help text is designed to work as a sort of ad-hoc Skill document.</description>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 09:00:19 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<title>The best Apple Watch in 2026</title>
<link>https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-apple-watch-160005462.html?src=rss</link>
<guid>title:the best apple watch in 2026</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 08:00:36 +0000</pubDate>
<description>There are just three models of Apple Watch — and $500 separates the most affordable from the premium model, with the flagship landing somewhere in between. Before the launch of the overhauled Apple Watch SE 3 in late 2025, it was pretty easy to direct most people to the Apple Watch Series 11. But with its new display and faster charging, the budget model makes a lot more sense now. There’s also a case for recommending the refreshed Apple Watch Ultra 3 to diehard adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts. Here, we spell out just what differentiates the models as well as what you get when you buy any Apple Watch. Using insights gleaned from Engadget’s own reviews, this guide will help you pick the best Apple Watch for you.</description>

<description>Agentic AI in Action — Designing Guardrails for Agentic AI Without Stifling Innovation Agentic AI is steadily moving from experimentation into real enterprise systems. Unlike traditional automation or assistive AI, agentic systems do not simply respond to instructions. They observe context, reason over data, make decisions, and take action toward defined outcomes. This shift introduces a fundamental challenge. How do organizations allow AI systems to act autonomously while still maintaining trust, accountability, and control? The instinctive response is often to introduce more rules, more approvals, and more restrictions.</description>

<description>Article Authored By Bobby Tredinnick LMSW-CASAC ; CEO &amp;amp; Lead Clinician at Interactive Health Companies including Coast Health Consulting &amp;amp; Interactive International Solutions Created By OpenAI Clinicians across the field are exhausted. Not the kind of tired fixed with a weekend off. The kind that comes from spending two hours after every session writing notes, another hour answering emails, and realizing more time has been spent staring at screens than looking at the people they trained to help. When 93% of behavioral health workers report experiencing burnout, and a third of the workforce spends most of their time on administrative tasks instead of direct client support, the field is not dealing with individual resilience problems. It’s dealing with a structural failure in how behavioral health work gets done. The answer sitting in front of most clinicians right now is so obvious that it gets dismissed.</description>

<description>Given the threat of cognitive debt brought on by AI-accelerated software development leading to more projects and less deep understanding of how they work and what they actually do, it's interesting to consider artifacts that might be able to help. Nathan Baschez on Twitter : my current favorite trick for reducing &quot;cognitive debt&quot; (h/t @simonw ) is to ask the LLM to write two versions of the plan: The version for it (highly technical and detailed) The version for me (an entertaining essay designed to build my intuition) Works great This inspired me to try something new. I generated the diff between v0. 5. 0 and v0. 6.</description>

<description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but running them locally requires significant hardware resources. Many users rely on open-source models due to their accessibility, as closed source models often come with restrictive licensing and high costs. In this blog, I will explain how open-source LLMs function, using DeepSeek as an example. Installing Ollama and Running LLMs Locally To get started, you need to install Ollama , which provides an easy way to run and manage LLMs locally. Follow these steps: Download and install Ollama from the official website: https://ollama. com Or install via the command line: curl -fsSL https://ollama.</description>

<title>Rodney and Claude Code for Desktop</title>

<description>I'm a very heavy user of Claude Code on the web , Anthropic's excellent but poorly named cloud version of Claude Code where everything runs in a container environment managed by them, greatly reducing the risk of anything bad happening to a computer I care about. I don't use the web interface at all (hence my dislike of the name) - I access it exclusively through their native iPhone and Mac desktop apps. Something I particularly appreciate about the desktop app is that it lets you see images that Claude is &quot;viewing&quot; via its Read /path/to/image tool. Here's what that looks like: This means you can get a visual preview of what it's working on while it's working, without waiting for it to push code to GitHub for you to try out yourself later on. The prompt I used to trigger the above screenshot was: Run &quot;uvx rodney --help&quot; and then use Rodney to manually test the new pages and menu - look at screenshots from it and check you think they look OK I designed Rodney to have --help output that provides everything a coding agent needs to know in order to use the tool. The Claude iPhone app doesn't display opened images yet, so I requested it as a feature just now in a thread on Twitter.</description>
