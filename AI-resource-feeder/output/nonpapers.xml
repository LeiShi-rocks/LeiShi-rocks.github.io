<guid>title:anthropic partners with codepath to bring claude to the us s largest collegiate computer science program</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 09:02:01 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Anthropic is partnering with CodePath, the nation’s largest provider of collegiate computer science education, to redesign its coding curriculum as AI reshapes the field of software development. CodePath will put Claude and Claude Code at the center of its courses and career programs, giving more than 20,000 students at community colleges, state schools, and HBCUs access to frontier AI tools as part of their education. Over 40% of CodePath students come from families earning under $50,000 a year, and CodePath aims to provide them with industry-vetted courses and access to career networks traditionally reserved for students at wealthier institutions. CodePath is integrating Claude into its AI courses—including Foundations of AI Engineering, Applications of AI Engineering, and AI Open-Source Capstone—so students can learn to build with tools like Claude Code and contribute to real-world open-source projects.</description>

<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 09:02:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>India is the second-largest market for Claude. ai , home to a developer community doing some of the most technically intense AI work we see anywhere. Nearly half of Claude usage in India comprises computer and mathematical tasks: building applications, modernizing systems, and shipping production software. Today, as we officially open our Bengaluru office, we’re announcing partnerships across enterprise, education, and agriculture that deepen our commitment to India across a range of sectors. “India represents one of the world’s most promising opportunities to bring the benefits of responsible AI to vastly more people and enterprises,” said Irina Ghose, Managing Director of India, Anthropic. “Already, it’s home to extraordinary technical talent, digital infrastructure at scale, and a proven track record of using technology to improve people’s lives.</description>

<guid>title:introducing claude opus 4 6</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 09:01:50 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We’re upgrading our smartest model. The new Claude Opus 4. 6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4. 6 features a 1M token context window in beta 1 .</description>

<description>We’re upgrading our smartest model. Across agentic coding, computer use, tool use, search, and finance, Opus 4. 6 is an industry-leading model, often by wide margin. We have raised $30 billion in Series G funding led by GIC and Coatue, valuing Anthropic at $380 billion post-money. The investment will fuel the frontier research, product development, and infrastructure expansions that have made Anthropic the market leader in enterprise AI and coding. Our run-rate revenue is $14 billion, with this figure growing over 10x annually in each of those past three years.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<title>AXRP Episode 48 - Guive Assadi on AI Property Rights</title>

<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 15, 2026 2:20 AM GMT YouTube link In this episode, Guive Assadi argues that we should give AIs property rights, so that they are integrated in our system of property and come to rely on it. The claim is that this means that AIs would not kill or steal from humans, because that would undermine the whole property system, which would be extremely valuable to them. Topics we discuss: AI property rights Why not steal from and kill humans Why AIs may fear it could be them next AI retirement Could humans be upgraded to stay useful? Will AI progress continue? Why non-obsoletable AIs may still not end human property rights Why make AIs with property rights? Do property rights incentivize alignment?</description>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 09:01:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<description>We coined a new term on the Oxide and Friends podcast last month (primary credit to Adam Leventhal) covering the sense of psychological ennui leading into existential dread that many software developers are feeling thanks to the encroachment of generative AI into their field of work. We're calling it Deep Blue . You can listen to it being coined in real time from 47:15 in the episode . I've included a transcript below . Deep Blue is a very real issue. Becoming a professional software engineer is hard .</description>

<description>The AI Vampire Steve Yegge's take on agent fatigue, and its relationship to burnout. Let's pretend you're the only person at your company using AI. In Scenario A, you decide you're going to impress your employer, and work for 8 hours a day at 10x productivity. You knock it out of the park and make everyone else look terrible by comparison. In that scenario, your employer captures 100% of the value from you adopting AI. You get nothing, or at any rate, it ain't gonna be 9x your salary.</description>

<guid>title:signs of introspection in large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 09:01:37 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Have you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so? Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability.</description>

<description>The Economic Research team studies how AI is reshaping the economy, including work, productivity, and economic opportunity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, we track AI's real-world economic effects and publish research that helps policymakers, businesses, and the public understand and prepare for the changes ahead. We build the empirical foundation for understanding AI's economic impact. Our flagship Anthropic Economic Index tracks how AI tools are actually being used around the world and across every sector of the economy—moving beyond speculation to measure adoption patterns as they unfold. Alongside our index reports, we produce novel research that studies the implications of AI usage and diffusion—as tracked in the index—for workers, for firms, and for the broader economy. Economic transitions create both opportunity and disruption.</description>

<description>Future AI systems will be even more powerful than today’s, likely in ways that break key assumptions behind current safety techniques. That’s why it’s important to develop sophisticated safeguards to ensure models remain helpful, honest, and harmless. The Alignment team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely. Alignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own. Alignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.</description>

<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 19:38:50 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 12, 2026 7:38 PM GMT 1. Summary and overview LLMs seem to lack metacognitive skills that help humans catch errors. Improvements to those skills might be net positive for alignment, despite improving capabilities in new directions. Better metacognition would reduce LLM errors by catching mistakes, and by managing complex cognition to produce better answers in the first place. This could stabilize or regularize alignment, allowing systems to avoid actions they would not &quot;endorse on reflection&quot; (in some functional sense). [1] Better metacognition could also make LLM systems useful for clarifying the conceptual problems of alignment.</description>

<guid>title:three months of openclaw</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 17:23:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>It's wild that the first commit to OpenClaw was on November 25th 2025 , and less than three months later it's hit 10,000 commits from 600 contributors, attracted 196,000 GitHub stars and sort-of been featured in an extremely vague Super Bowl commercial for AI. com . Quoting AI. com founder Kris Marszalek , purchaser of the most expensive domain in history for $70m: ai. com is the world’s first easy-to-use and secure implementation of OpenClaw, the open source agent framework that went viral two weeks ago; we made it easy to use without any technical skills, while hardening security to keep your data safe. Looks like vaporware to me - all you can do right now is reserve a handle - but it's still remarkable to see an open source project get to that level of hype in such a short space of time.</description>

<title>How do we (more) safely defer to AIs?</title>

<guid>title:how do we more safely defer to ais</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:55:52 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 12, 2026 4:55 PM GMT As AI systems get more capable, it becomes increasingly uncompetitive and infeasible to avoid deferring to AIs on increasingly many decisions. Further, once systems are sufficiently capable, control becomes infeasible . [1] Thus, one of the main strategies for handling AI risk is fully (or almost fully) deferring to AIs on managing these risks. Broadly speaking, when I say &quot;deferring to AIs&quot; [2] I mean having these AIs do virtually all of the work to develop more capable and aligned successor AIs, managing exogenous risks, and making strategic decisions. [3] If we plan to defer to AIs, I think it's safest to do so only a bit above the minimum level of qualitative capability/intelligence required to automate safety research, implementation, and strategy. [4] For deference to go well, we both need it to be the case that the AIs we defer to aren't scheming against us and that they are sufficiently aligned and effective on key tasks (aligning the next generation of AIs, buying more time to work on alignment, making good strategic decisions).</description>
