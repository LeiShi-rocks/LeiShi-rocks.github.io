<description>Modern biological research generates data at unprecedented scale—from single-cell sequencing to whole-brain connectomics—yet transforming that data into validated biological insights remains a fundamental bottleneck. Knowledge synthesis, hypothesis generation, and experimental interpretation still depend on manual processes that can't keep pace with the data being produced. Today, Anthropic is announcing two flagship partnerships designed to close that gap. The Allen Institute and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) will serve as founding partners in life sciences, extending Claude’s capabilities to frontier scientific research and enabling teams of scientists to work more effectively together and take on ambitious scientific challenges. Each collaboration brings together Anthropic's expertise in foundation models, agentic systems, and interpretability with world-class research institutions tackling distinct but complementary problems in biology and biomedical science. These partnerships position Claude at the center of scientific experimentation and will build a foundation in which scientists actively use Claude to plan and execute experiments.</description>

<title>Apple’s Xcode now supports the Claude Agent SDK</title>

<description>Apple's Xcode is where developers build, test, and distribute apps for Apple platforms, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple Vision Pro, and Apple TV. In September, we announced that developers would have access to Claude Sonnet 4 in Xcode 26. Claude could be used to write code, debug, and generate documentation—but it was limited to helping with individual, turn-by-turn requests. Now, Xcode 26.3 introduces a native integration with the Claude Agent SDK , the same underlying harness that powers Claude Code. Developers get the full power of Claude Code directly in Xcode—including subagents, background tasks, and plugins—all without leaving the IDE.</description>

<description>Claude Sonnet 4. 5 is the best coding model in the world. It's the strongest model for building complex agents. It’s the best model at using computers. And it shows substantial gains in reasoning and math. Code is everywhere.</description>

<title>ServiceNow chooses Claude to power customer apps and increase internal productivity</title>

<description>As enterprises move beyond experimenting with AI and start putting it into production across their core business operations, scale and security matters just as much as capabilities. With this in mind, ServiceNow, which helps large companies manage and automate everything from IT support to HR to customer service on a single platform, has chosen Claude as its default model for its ServiceNow Build Agent, and as a preferred model across the ServiceNow AI Platform. Build Agent helps developers of all skill levels build and use Claude as an “agent” that can reason, decide on actions, and execute tasks autonomously. In addition, ServiceNow is rolling out Claude and Claude Code across its global workforce of more than 29,000 employees to streamline sales preparation—cutting seller preparation time by 95% and boosting engineering productivity with Claude Code to reduce the time between idea and implementation across the organization.</description>

<title>Introducing Claude Opus 4.6</title>

<description>We’re upgrading our smartest model. The new Claude Opus 4. 6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4. 6 features a 1M token context window in beta.</description>
