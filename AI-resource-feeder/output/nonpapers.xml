<guid>title:introducing claude opus 4 6</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:02:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We’re upgrading our smartest model. The new Claude Opus 4. 6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4. 6 features a 1M token context window in beta 1 .</description>

<description>Sonnet 4. 6 delivers frontier performance across coding, agents, and professional work at scale. We’re upgrading our smartest model. Across agentic coding, computer use, tool use, search, and finance, Opus 4. 6 is an industry-leading model, often by wide margin. We’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The Government of Rwanda and Anthropic have signed a three-year Memorandum of Understanding to formalize and expand our partnership, bringing AI to Rwanda’s education, health, and public sector systems. This agreement builds on the ALX education partnership we announced in November 2025 and marks the first time Anthropic has formalized a multi-sector partnership through a government MOU on the African continent. Our collaboration spans three areas: “This partnership with Anthropic is an important milestone in Rwanda’s AI journey. Our goal is to continue to design and deploy AI solutions that can be applied at a national level to strengthen education, advance health outcomes, and enhance governance with an emphasis on our context,” said Paula Ingabire, Minister of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Innovation in Rwanda.</description>

<description>Claude Code Security , a new capability built into Claude Code on the web, is now available in a limited research preview. It scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, allowing teams to find and fix security issues that traditional methods often miss. Security teams face a common challenge: too many software vulnerabilities and not enough people to address them. Existing analysis tools help, but only to a point, as they usually look for known patterns. Finding the subtle, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are often exploited by attackers requires skilled human researchers, who are dealing with ever-expanding backlogs. AI is beginning to change that calculus.</description>

<title>Detecting and preventing distillation attacks</title>

<guid>title:detecting and preventing distillation attacks</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:02:56 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We have identified industrial-scale campaigns by three AI laboratories—DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax—to illicitly extract Claude’s capabilities to improve their own models. These labs generated over 16 million exchanges with Claude through approximately 24,000 fraudulent accounts, in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions. These labs used a technique called “distillation,” which involves training a less capable model on the outputs of a stronger one. Distillation is a widely used and legitimate training method. For example, frontier AI labs routinely distill their own models to create smaller, cheaper versions for their customers. But distillation can also be used for illicit purposes: competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<guid>title:agentic ai in action part 10 beyond frameworks building the core loop from first principles</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:45:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Beyond Frameworks: Building the Agent Core Loop From First Principles In the series of Agentic AI blogs, we have seen practical examples built using frameworks. We have also examined guardrails, governance, and why many impressive agent demos struggle when they encounter real operational complexity. At this point, it becomes useful to pause and strip everything back to first principles. Frameworks play an important role in accelerating the development of agentic systems and in turning ideas into working solutions quickly. At the same time, their real value becomes clearer when we understand the underlying mechanics they build upon, particularly how decisions evolve over time. When we momentarily look beneath these layers, agentic behavior does not disappear; instead, its foundation becomes visible as a simple but powerful loop that observes state, decides what to do next, acts on that decision, and updates itself until a stable outcome is reached.</description>

<description>A Guest Contribution by Tanishq Singh and Jiten Oswal If you’ve been following the AI agent space in early 2026, you’ve probably noticed something: the conversation has shifted. We’re no longer debating whether agents work. We’re debating how to make them reliable , reusable , and composable . The answer, it turns out, isn’t a better model. It’s better infrastructure around the model (honestly that’s what engineering is! ) If you are building AI Agents you would relate to this that probably 80% of your time and effort is spent not in LLM reasoning, but in everything around it: logging, state management, safety, evals, orchestration, memory management, context handling, tooling etc.</description>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:02:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<description>For the past year, AI devs have relied on the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern—a simple loop where an LLM thinks, picks a tool, and executes. But as any software engineer who has tried to move these agents into production knows, simple loops are brittle.

<description>In the world of Generative AI, latency is the ultimate killer of immersion. Until recently, building a voice-enabled AI agent felt like assembling a Rube Goldberg machine: you’d pipe audio to a Speech-to-Text (STT) model, send the transcript to a Large Language Model (LLM), and finally shuttle text to a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine.

<description>In 2025, if you walked into any AI conference, you may hear the same gospel: faster inference, longer context windows, cheaper inference costs. It's as if we've spent years perfecting the hammer, making it lighter, stronger, more precisely balanced, while never questioning the fact that the carpenter still has only two hands and twenty-four hours in a day. Now, Kimi introduces Agent Swarm. It is not a better hammer. It is a reconstruction of the entire workshop.</description>

<guid>title:signs of introspection in large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:02:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Have you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so? Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability.</description>

<description>The Economic Research team studies how AI is reshaping the economy, including work, productivity, and economic opportunity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, we track AI's real-world economic effects and publish research that helps policymakers, businesses, and the public understand and prepare for the changes ahead. We build the empirical foundation for understanding AI's economic impact. Our flagship Anthropic Economic Index tracks how AI tools are actually being used around the world and across every sector of the economy—moving beyond speculation to measure adoption patterns as they unfold. Alongside our index reports, we produce novel research that studies the implications of AI usage and diffusion—as tracked in the index—for workers, for firms, and for the broader economy. Economic transitions create both opportunity and disruption.</description>

<description>Future AI systems will be even more powerful than today’s, likely in ways that break key assumptions behind current safety techniques. That’s why it’s important to develop sophisticated safeguards to ensure models remain helpful, honest, and harmless. The Alignment team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely. Alignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own. Alignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.</description>

<description>I'm a bug bounty hunter and pentester. I've spent the last 5 years chasing security vulnerabilities in web apps, from small local companies to Google and Reddit. When vibe-coding took off, social media got flooded with memes about insecure vibe-coded apps. And honestly? They're not wrong. There are 2 reasons for this: Most vibe coders don't have a dev background - so they're not aware of security risks in the first place LLMs produce vulnerable code by default - doesn't matter which model, they all make the same mistakes unless you explicitly guide them From a bug hunter's perspective, security is about finding exceptions ; the edge cases developers forgot to handle.</description>

<description>Ladybird adopts Rust, with help from AI Really interesting case-study from Andreas Kling on advanced, sophisticated use of coding agents for ambitious coding projects with critical code. After a few years hoping Swift's platform support outside of the Apple ecosystem would mature they switched tracks to Rust their memory-safe language of choice, starting with an AI-assisted port of a critical library: Our first target was LibJS , Ladybird's JavaScript engine. The lexer, parser, AST, and bytecode generator are relatively self-contained and have extensive test coverage through test262 , which made them a natural starting point. I used Claude Code and Codex for the translation. This was human-directed, not autonomous code generation. I decided what to port, in what order, and what the Rust code should look like.</description>

<description>Avneesh Saluja , Santiago Castro , Bowei Yan , Ashish Rastogi Introduction Netflix’s core mission is to connect millions of members around the world with stories they’ll love. This requires not just an incredible catalog, but also a deep, machine-level understanding of every piece of content in that catalog, from the biggest blockbusters to the most niche documentaries. As we onboard new types of content such as live events and podcasts, the need to scalably understand these nuances becomes even more critical to our productions and member-facing experiences. Many of these media-related tasks require sophisticated long-form video understanding e. g. , identifying subtle narrative dependencies and emotional arcs that span entire episodes or films.</description>

<title>Writing about Agentic Engineering Patterns</title>

<guid>title:writing about agentic engineering patterns</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 17:43:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>I've started a new project to collect and document Agentic Engineering Patterns - coding practices and patterns to help get the best results out of this new era of coding agent development we find ourselves entering. I'm using Agentic Engineering to refer to building software using coding agents - tools like Claude Code and OpenAI Codex, where the defining feature is that they can both generate and execute code - allowing them to test that code and iterate on it independently of turn-by-turn guidance from their human supervisor. I think of vibe coding using its original definition of coding where you pay no attention to the code at all, which today is often associated with non-programmers using LLMs to write code. Agentic Engineering represents the other end of the scale: professional software engineers using coding agents to improve and accelerate their work by amplifying their existing expertise. There is so much to learn and explore about this new discipline! I've already published a lot under my ai-assisted-programming tag (345 posts and counting) but that's been relatively unstructured.</description>

<title>Writing code is cheap now</title>

<guid>title:writing code is cheap now</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 16:20:42 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Agentic Engineering Patterns &amp;gt; The biggest challenge in adopting agentic engineering practices is getting comfortable with the consequences of the fact that writing code is cheap now . Code has always been expensive. Producing a few hundred lines of clean, tested code takes most software developers a full day or more. Many of our engineering habits, at both the macro and micro level, are built around this core constraint. At the macro level we spend a great deal of time designing, estimating and planning out projects, to ensure that our expensive coding time is spent as efficiently as possible.
