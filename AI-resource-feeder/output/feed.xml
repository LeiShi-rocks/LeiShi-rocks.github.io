<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<title>MEME: Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11918</link>
<guid>title:meme modeling the evolutionary modes of financial markets</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 13:16:05 +0000</pubDate>
<description>LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes.</description>

<title>Beyond End-to-End Video Models: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Educational Video Generation</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11790</link>
<guid>title:beyond end to end video models an llm based multi agent system for educational video generation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 10:14:36 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks.</description>

<title>Composition-RL: Compose Your Verifiable Prompts for Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.12036</link>
<guid>title:composition rl compose your verifiable prompts for reinforcement learning of large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 15:03:37 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large-scale verifiable prompts underpin the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but they contain many uninformative examples and are costly to expand further. Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with a pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into a new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that Composition-RL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset.</description>

<description>Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations.</description>

<title>Move What Matters: Parameter-Efficient Domain Adaptation via Optimal Transport Flow for Collaborative Perception</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11565</link>
<guid>title:move what matters parameter efficient domain adaptation via optimal transport flow for collaborative perception</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:36:50 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Fast domain adaptation remains a fundamental challenge for deploying multi-agent systems across diverse environments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception. Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation.</description>

<title>Knowledge Integration Decay in Search-Augmented Reasoning of Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.09517</link>
<guid>title:knowledge integration decay in search augmented reasoning of large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:20:26 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks by employing search-augmented reasoning to incorporate external knowledge into long chains of thought. However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs.</description>

<title>SceneReVis: A Self-Reflective Vision-Grounded Framework for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Multi-turn RL</title>

<guid>title:scenerevis a self reflective vision grounded framework for 3d indoor scene synthesis via multi turn rl</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:55:56 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Current one-pass 3D scene synthesis methods often suffer from spatial hallucinations, such as collisions, due to a lack of deliberative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SceneReVis, a vision-grounded self-reflection framework that employs an iterative ``diagnose-and-act'' loop to explicitly intercept and resolve spatial conflicts using multi-modal feedback. To support this step-wise paradigm, we construct SceneChain-12k, a large-scale dataset of causal construction trajectories derived through a novel reverse engineering pipeline. We further propose a two-stage training recipe that transitions from Supervised Fine-Tuning to Agentic Reinforcement Learning, evolving the model into an active spatial planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneReVis achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity generation and goal-oriented optimization, with robust generalization to long-tail domains.</description>

<guid>title:r2rag flood a reasoning reinforced training free retrieval augmentation generation framework for flood damage nowcasting</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 21:31:33 +0000</pubDate>
<description>R2RAG-Flood is a reasoning-reinforced, training-free retrieval-augmented generation framework for post-storm property damage nowcasting. Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0. 714 overall accuracy and 0.</description>

<title>Disentangling Ambiguity from Instability in Large Language Models: A Clinical Text-to-SQL Case Study</title>

<guid>title:disentangling ambiguity from instability in large language models a clinical text to sql case study</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 14:46:20 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Deploying large language models for clinical Text-to-SQL requires distinguishing two qualitatively different causes of output diversity: (i) input ambiguity that should trigger clarification, and (ii) model instability that should trigger human review. We propose CLUES, a framework that models Text-to-SQL as a two-stage process (interpretations --&gt; answers) and decomposes semantic uncertainty into an ambiguity score and an instability score. The instability score is computed via the Schur complement of a bipartite semantic graph matrix. Across AmbigQA/SituatedQA (gold interpretations) and a clinical Text-to-SQL benchmark (known interpretations), CLUES improves failure prediction over state-of-the-art Kernel Language Entropy. In deployment settings, it remains competitive while providing a diagnostic decomposition unavailable from a single score. The resulting uncertainty regimes map to targeted interventions - query refinement for ambiguity, model improvement for instability.</description>

<guid>title:multi task learning with additive u net for image denoising and classification</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 06:15:32 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We investigate additive skip fusion in U-Net architectures for image denoising and denoising-centric multi-task learning (MTL). By replacing concatenative skips with gated additive fusion, the proposed Additive U-Net (AddUNet) constrains shortcut capacity while preserving fixed feature dimensionality across depth. This structural regularization induces controlled encoder-decoder information flow and stabilizes joint optimization. Across single-task denoising and joint denoising-classification settings, AddUNet achieves competitive reconstruction performance with improved training stability. In MTL, learned skip weights exhibit systematic task-aware redistribution: shallow skips favor reconstruction, while deeper features support discrimination. Notably, reconstruction remains robust even under limited classification capacity, indicating implicit task decoupling through additive fusion.</description>

<title>ARK: A Dual-Axis Multimodal Retrieval Benchmark along Reasoning and Knowledge</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.09839</link>
<guid>title:ark a dual axis multimodal retrieval benchmark along reasoning and knowledge</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 14:45:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks largely emphasize semantic matching on daily-life images and offer limited diagnostics of professional knowledge and complex reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks. We further show that simple enhancements such as re-ranking and rewriting yield consistent improvements, but substantial headroom remains.</description>

<title>Supervise-assisted Multi-modality Fusion Diffusion Model for PET Restoration</title>

<guid>title:supervise assisted multi modality fusion diffusion model for pet restoration</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:06:48 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Positron emission tomography (PET) offers powerful functional imaging but involves radiation exposure. Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model.</description>

<description>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training software engineering (SWE) agents, but existing pipelines typically rely on per-task containers for isolation. At scale, pre-built container images incur substantial storage overhead, slow environment setup, and require container-management privileges. We propose SWE-MiniSandbox, a lightweight, container-free method that enables scalable RL training of SWE agents without sacrificing isolation. Instead of relying on per-instance containers, SWE-MiniSandbox executes each task in an isolated workspace backed by kernel-level mechanisms, substantially reducing system overhead. It leverages lightweight environment pre-caching techniques to eliminate the need for bulky container images. As a result, our approach lowers disk usage to approximately 5\% of that required by container-based pipelines and reduces environment preparation time to about 25\% of the container baseline.</description>

<guid>title:flashvid efficient video large language models via training free tree based spatiotemporal token merging</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:56:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Although Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in video understanding, they are required to process high volumes of visual tokens, causing significant computational inefficiency. Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.</description>

<title>Towards Reliable Machine Translation: Scaling LLMs for Critical Error Detection and Safety</title>

<guid>title:towards reliable machine translation scaling llms for critical error detection and safety</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 23:47:39 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Machine Translation (MT) plays a pivotal role in cross-lingual information access, public policy communication, and equitable knowledge dissemination. However, critical meaning errors, such as factual distortions, intent reversals, or biased translations, can undermine the reliability, fairness, and safety of multilingual systems. In this work, we explore the capacity of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect such critical errors, evaluating models across a range of parameters using the publicly accessible data sets. Our findings show that model scaling and adaptation strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) yield consistent improvements, outperforming encoder-only baselines like XLM-R and ModernBERT. We argue that improving critical error detection in MT contributes to safer, more trustworthy, and socially accountable information systems by reducing the risk of disinformation, miscommunication, and linguistic harm, especially in high-stakes or underrepresented contexts. This work positions error detection not merely as a technical challenge, but as a necessary safeguard in the pursuit of just and responsible multilingual AI.</description>

<guid>title:triggers hijack language circuits a mechanistic analysis of backdoor behaviors in large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:04:32 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Backdoor attacks pose significant security risks for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the internal mechanisms by which triggers operate remain poorly understood. We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7. 5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0. 18 and 0.</description>

<title>Learning Self-Interpretation from Interpretability Artifacts: Training Lightweight Adapters on Vector-Label Pairs</title>

<guid>title:learning self interpretation from interpretability artifacts training lightweight adapters on vector label pairs</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 22:50:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Self-interpretation methods prompt language models to describe their own internal states, but remain unreliable due to hyperparameter sensitivity. We show that training lightweight adapters on interpretability artifacts, while keeping the LM entirely frozen, yields reliable self-interpretation across tasks and model families. A scalar affine adapter with just $d_\text{model}+1$ parameters suffices: trained adapters generate sparse autoencoder feature labels that outperform the training labels themselves (71% vs 63% generation scoring at 70B scale), identify topics with 94% recall@1 versus 1% for untrained baselines, and decode bridge entities in multi-hop reasoning that appear in neither prompt nor response, surfacing implicit reasoning without chain-of-thought. The learned bias vector alone accounts for 85% of improvement, and simpler adapters generalize better than more expressive alternatives. Controlling for model knowledge via prompted descriptions, we find self-interpretation gains outpace capability gains from 7B to 72B parameters. Our results demonstrate that self-interpretation improves with scale, without modifying the model being interpreted.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:56:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Language models have become practical tools for quantum computing education and research, from summarizing technical papers to explaining theoretical concepts and answering questions about recent developments in the field. While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%.</description>

<title>Interpretable Vision Transformers in Image Classification via SVDA</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.10994</link>
<guid>title:interpretable vision transformers in image classification via svda</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:20:32 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification, yet their attention mechanisms often remain opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors. In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.</description>

<guid>title:latent generative solvers for generalizable long term physics simulation</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 15:34:52 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2. 5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families.</description>

<title>What, Whether and How? Unveiling Process Reward Models for Thinking with Images Reasoning</title>

<guid>title:what whether and how unveiling process reward models for thinking with images reasoning</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 07:31:14 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The rapid advancement of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has demonstrated excellent abilities in various visual tasks. Building upon these developments, the thinking with images paradigm has emerged, enabling models to dynamically edit and re-encode visual information at each reasoning step, mirroring human visual processing. However, this paradigm introduces significant challenges as diverse errors may occur during reasoning processes. This necessitates Process Reward Models (PRMs) for distinguishing positive and negative reasoning steps, yet existing benchmarks for PRMs are predominantly text-centric and lack comprehensive assessment under this paradigm. To address these gaps, this work introduces the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating PRMs under the thinking with images paradigm. Our main contributions are: (1) Through extensive analysis of reasoning trajectories and guided search experiments with PRMs, we define 7 fine-grained error types and demonstrate both the necessity for specialized PRMs and the potential for improvement.</description>

<description>We introduce MILE-RefHumEval, a reference-free framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) without ground-truth annotations or evaluator coordination. It leverages an ensemble of independently prompted evaluators guided by a human-aligned schema, supporting both discrete and continuous scoring judgement. With task-specific prompts from best candidate selection, summarization and image captioning to dialogue, MILE-RefHumEval provides flexible, interpretable, and scalable assessments. Experiments show it aligns closely with human judgments, outperforms prior methods, and reduces computational overhead, offering an efficient, robust, and human-aligned solution for real-world LLM evaluation.</description>

<guid>title:a unified framework for multimodal image reconstruction and synthesis using denoising diffusion models</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 03:54:24 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Image reconstruction and image synthesis are important for handling incomplete multimodal imaging data, but existing methods require various task-specific models, complicating training and deployment workflows. We introduce Any2all, a unified framework that addresses this limitation by formulating these disparate tasks as a single virtual inpainting problem. We train a single, unconditional diffusion model on the complete multimodal data stack. This model is then adapted at inference time to ``inpaint'' all target modalities from any combination of inputs of available clean images or noisy measurements. We validated Any2all on a PET/MR/CT brain dataset. Our results show that Any2all can achieve excellent performance on both multimodal reconstruction and synthesis tasks, consistently yielding images with competitive distortion-based performance and superior perceptual quality over specialized methods.</description>

<guid>title:chamelion reliable change detection for long term lidar mapping in transient environments</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 01:15:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Online change detection is crucial for mobile robots to efficiently navigate through dynamic environments. Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations.</description>

<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:10:17 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet current methods rely on rigid templates to specify reasoning primitives (e. g. , objects in the scene, high-level plans, structural affordances). These templates can force policies to process irrelevant information that distracts from critical action-prediction signals. This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&amp;amp;B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:02:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Today's business organizations need access control systems that can handle complex, changing security requirements that go beyond what traditional methods can manage. Current approaches, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), were designed for specific purposes. They cannot effectively manage the dynamic, situation-dependent workflows that modern systems require. In this research, we introduce LLMAC, a new unified approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine these different access control methods into one comprehensive, understandable system. We used an extensive synthetic dataset that represents complex real-world scenarios, including policies for ownership verification, version management, workflow processes, and dynamic role separation. Using Mistral 7B, our trained LLM model achieved outstanding results with 98.</description>

<title>Exploring Multiple High-Scoring Subspaces in Generative Flow Networks</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11491</link>
<guid>title:exploring multiple high scoring subspaces in generative flow networks</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:30:52 +0000</pubDate>
<description>As a probabilistic sampling framework, Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) show strong potential for constructing complex combinatorial objects through the sequential composition of elementary components. However, existing GFlowNets often suffer from excessive exploration over vast state spaces, leading to over-sampling of low-reward regions and convergence to suboptimal distributions. Effectively biasing GFlowNets toward high-reward solutions remains a non-trivial challenge. In this paper, we propose CMAB-GFN, which integrates a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework with GFlowNet policies. The CMAB component prunes low-quality actions, yielding compact high-scoring subspaces for exploration. Restricting GFNs to these compact high-scoring subspaces accelerates the discovery of high-value candidates, while the exploration of different subspaces ensures that diversity is not sacrificed.</description>

<guid>title:stabilizing physics informed consistency models via structure preserving training</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:40:19 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We propose a physics-informed consistency modeling framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) via fast, few-step generative inference. We identify a key stability challenge in physics-constrained consistency training, where PDE residuals can drive the model toward trivial or degenerate solutions, degrading the learned data distribution. To address this, we introduce a structure-preserving two-stage training strategy that decouples distribution learning from physics enforcement by freezing the coefficient decoder during physics-informed fine-tuning. We further propose a two-step residual objective that enforces physical consistency on refined, structurally valid generative trajectories rather than noisy single-step predictions. The resulting framework enables stable, high-fidelity inference for both unconditional generation and forward problems. We demonstrate that forward solutions can be obtained via a projection-based zero-shot inpainting procedure, achieving consistent accuracy of diffusion baselines with orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost.</description>

<guid>title:the rise of sparse mixture of experts a survey from algorithmic foundations to decentralized architectures and vertical domain applications</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:39:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The sparse Mixture of Experts(MoE) architecture has evolved as a powerful approach for scaling deep learning models to more parameters with comparable computation cost. As an important branch of large language model(LLM), MoE model only activate a subset of experts based on a routing network. This sparse conditional computation mechanism significantly improves computational efficiency, paving a promising path for greater scalability and cost-efficiency. It not only enhance downstream applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal in various horizontal domains, but also exhibit broad applicability across vertical domains. Despite the growing popularity and application of MoE models across various domains, there lacks a systematic exploration of recent advancements of MoE in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE suffer from limitations such as lack coverage or none extensively exploration of key areas.</description>

<title>AXRP Episode 48 - Guive Assadi on AI Property Rights</title>

<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 15, 2026 2:20 AM GMT YouTube link In this episode, Guive Assadi argues that we should give AIs property rights, so that they are integrated in our system of property and come to rely on it. The claim is that this means that AIs would not kill or steal from humans, because that would undermine the whole property system, which would be extremely valuable to them. Topics we discuss: AI property rights Why not steal from and kill humans Why AIs may fear it could be them next AI retirement Could humans be upgraded to stay useful? Will AI progress continue? Why non-obsoletable AIs may still not end human property rights Why make AIs with property rights? Do property rights incentivize alignment?</description>

<title>What does RL improve for Visual Reasoning? A Frankenstein-Style Analysis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12395</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.12395</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602.12395v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has become a standard post-training stage for boosting visual reasoning in vision-language models, yet it remains unclear what capabilities RL actually improves compared with supervised fine-tuning as cold-start initialization (IN). End-to-end benchmark gains conflate multiple factors, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific skills. To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RL's reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not a uniform enhancement of visual perception, but a systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements.</description>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 09:01:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<description>We coined a new term on the Oxide and Friends podcast last month (primary credit to Adam Leventhal) covering the sense of psychological ennui leading into existential dread that many software developers are feeling thanks to the encroachment of generative AI into their field of work. We're calling it Deep Blue . You can listen to it being coined in real time from 47:15 in the episode . I've included a transcript below . Deep Blue is a very real issue. Becoming a professional software engineer is hard .</description>

<description>The AI Vampire Steve Yegge's take on agent fatigue, and its relationship to burnout. Let's pretend you're the only person at your company using AI. In Scenario A, you decide you're going to impress your employer, and work for 8 hours a day at 10x productivity. You knock it out of the park and make everyone else look terrible by comparison. In that scenario, your employer captures 100% of the value from you adopting AI. You get nothing, or at any rate, it ain't gonna be 9x your salary.</description>

<guid>title:signs of introspection in large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 09:01:37 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Have you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so? Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability.</description>

<description>The Economic Research team studies how AI is reshaping the economy, including work, productivity, and economic opportunity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, we track AI's real-world economic effects and publish research that helps policymakers, businesses, and the public understand and prepare for the changes ahead. We build the empirical foundation for understanding AI's economic impact. Our flagship Anthropic Economic Index tracks how AI tools are actually being used around the world and across every sector of the economy—moving beyond speculation to measure adoption patterns as they unfold. Alongside our index reports, we produce novel research that studies the implications of AI usage and diffusion—as tracked in the index—for workers, for firms, and for the broader economy. Economic transitions create both opportunity and disruption.</description>

<description>Future AI systems will be even more powerful than today’s, likely in ways that break key assumptions behind current safety techniques. That’s why it’s important to develop sophisticated safeguards to ensure models remain helpful, honest, and harmless. The Alignment team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely. Alignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own. Alignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.</description>

<description>Our research teams investigate the safety, inner workings, and societal impacts of AI models – so that artificial intelligence has a positive impact as it becomes increasingly capable. The mission of the Interpretability team is to discover and understand how large language models work internally, as a foundation for AI safety and positive outcomes. The Alignment team works to understand the risks of AI models and develop ways to ensure that future ones remain helpful, honest, and harmless.</description>

<description>India is building its own GPT-style AI models. Sarvam AI and BharatGen are developing large language models for Indian languages, governance, and real-world applications, marking a major step toward India’s AI independence. As countries race to build sovereign AI, India is entering the global AI race with homegrown innovation. This could shape the future of language technology, public services, and digital infrastructure. #AI #IndiaStartUps #TechNews #AINews #IndiaSummit #ThinkAIThinkAIM</description>

<description>Published on February 12, 2026 7:38 PM GMT 1. Summary and overview LLMs seem to lack metacognitive skills that help humans catch errors. Improvements to those skills might be net positive for alignment, despite improving capabilities in new directions. Better metacognition would reduce LLM errors by catching mistakes, and by managing complex cognition to produce better answers in the first place. This could stabilize or regularize alignment, allowing systems to avoid actions they would not &quot;endorse on reflection&quot; (in some functional sense). [1] Better metacognition could also make LLM systems useful for clarifying the conceptual problems of alignment.</description>

<title>Three months of OpenClaw</title>

<guid>title:three months of openclaw</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 17:23:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>It's wild that the first commit to OpenClaw was on November 25th 2025 , and less than three months later it's hit 10,000 commits from 600 contributors, attracted 196,000 GitHub stars and sort-of been featured in an extremely vague Super Bowl commercial for AI. com . Quoting AI. com founder Kris Marszalek , purchaser of the most expensive domain in history for $70m: ai. com is the world’s first easy-to-use and secure implementation of OpenClaw, the open source agent framework that went viral two weeks ago; we made it easy to use without any technical skills, while hardening security to keep your data safe. Looks like vaporware to me - all you can do right now is reserve a handle - but it's still remarkable to see an open source project get to that level of hype in such a short space of time.</description>

<title>How do we (more) safely defer to AIs?</title>
<link>https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vjAM7F8vMZS7oRrrh/how-do-we-more-safely-defer-to-ais</link>
<guid>title:how do we more safely defer to ais</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:55:52 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 12, 2026 4:55 PM GMT As AI systems get more capable, it becomes increasingly uncompetitive and infeasible to avoid deferring to AIs on increasingly many decisions. Further, once systems are sufficiently capable, control becomes infeasible . [1] Thus, one of the main strategies for handling AI risk is fully (or almost fully) deferring to AIs on managing these risks. Broadly speaking, when I say &quot;deferring to AIs&quot; [2] I mean having these AIs do virtually all of the work to develop more capable and aligned successor AIs, managing exogenous risks, and making strategic decisions. [3] If we plan to defer to AIs, I think it's safest to do so only a bit above the minimum level of qualitative capability/intelligence required to automate safety research, implementation, and strategy. [4] For deference to go well, we both need it to be the case that the AIs we defer to aren't scheming against us and that they are sufficiently aligned and effective on key tasks (aligning the next generation of AIs, buying more time to work on alignment, making good strategic decisions).</description>
