<title>TiMi: Empower Time Series Transformers with Multimodal Mixture of Experts</title>

<description>Multimodal time series forecasting has garnered significant attention for its potential to provide more accurate predictions than traditional single-modality models by leveraging rich information inherent in other modalities. However, due to fundamental challenges in modality alignment, existing methods often struggle to effectively incorporate multimodal data into predictions, particularly textual information that has a causal influence on time series fluctuations, such as emergency reports and policy announcements. In this paper, we reflect on the role of textual information in numerical forecasting and propose Time series transformers with Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts, TiMi, to unleash the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Concretely, TiMi utilizes LLMs to generate inferences on future developments, which serve as guidance for time series forecasting. To seamlessly integrate both exogenous factors and time series into predictions, we introduce a Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) module as a lightweight plug-in to empower Transformer-based time series models for multimodal forecasting, eliminating the need for explicit representation-level alignment. Experimentally, our proposed TiMi demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance on sixteen real-world multimodal forecasting benchmarks, outperforming advanced baselines while offering both strong adaptability and interpretability.</description>

<title>RobustVisRAG: Causality-Aware Vision-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation under Visual Degradations</title>

<guid>title:robustvisrag causality aware vision based retrieval augmented generation under visual degradations</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 15:27:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Vision-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG) leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to jointly retrieve relevant visual documents and generate grounded answers based on multimodal evidence. However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 15:12:17 +0000</pubDate>
<description>360 panoramic images are increasingly used in virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics for holistic scene understanding. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14. 8K questions across five categories (e. g. , relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes.</description>

<title>GeoDiv: Framework For Measuring Geographical Diversity In Text-To-Image Models</title>

<guid>title:geodiv framework for measuring geographical diversity in text to image models</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 17:08:43 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Text-to-image (T2I) models are rapidly gaining popularity, yet their outputs often lack geographical diversity, reinforce stereotypes, and misrepresent regions. Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX. 1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals.</description>

<title>See It, Say It, Sorted: An Iterative Training-Free Framework for Visually-Grounded Multimodal Reasoning in LVLMs</title>

<guid>title:see it say it sorted an iterative training free framework for visually grounded multimodal reasoning in lvlms</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 02:13:59 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning ability by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) responses. However, CoT reasoning in multimodal contexts is highly vulnerable to visual hallucination propagation: once an intermediate reasoning step becomes inconsistent with the visual evidence, subsequent steps-even if logically valid-can still lead to incorrect final answers. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to &quot;think with images&quot; via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues.</description>

<title>ProactiveMobile: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Boosting Proactive Intelligence on Mobile Devices</title>

<guid>title:proactivemobile a comprehensive benchmark for boosting proactive intelligence on mobile devices</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 12:32:37 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in mobile agent development, yet their capabilities are predominantly confined to a reactive paradigm, where they merely execute explicit user commands. The emerging paradigm of proactive intelligence, where agents autonomously anticipate needs and initiate actions, represents the next frontier for mobile agents. However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations.</description>

<guid>title:docdjinn controllable synthetic document generation with vlms and handwriting diffusion</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 11:52:13 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Effective document intelligence models rely on large amounts of annotated training data. However, procuring sufficient and high-quality data poses significant challenges due to the labor-intensive and costly nature of data acquisition. Additionally, leveraging language models to annotate real documents raises concerns about data privacy. Synthetic document generation has emerged as a promising, privacy-preserving alternative. We propose DocDjinn, a novel framework for controllable synthetic document generation using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that produces annotated documents from unlabeled seed samples. Our approach generates visually plausible and semantically consistent synthetic documents that follow the distribution of an existing source dataset through clustering-based seed selection with parametrized sampling.</description>

<title>From Words to Amino Acids: Does the Curse of Depth Persist?</title>

<guid>title:from words to amino acids does the curse of depth persist</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 10:06:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Protein language models (PLMs) have become widely adopted as general-purpose models, demonstrating strong performance in protein engineering and de novo design. Like large language models (LLMs), they are typically trained as deep transformers with next-token or masked-token prediction objectives on massive sequence corpora and are scaled by increasing model depth. Recent work on autoregressive LLMs has identified the Curse of Depth: later layers contribute little to the final output predictions. These findings naturally raise the question of whether a similar depth inefficiency also appears in PLMs, where many widely used models are not autoregressive, and some are multimodal, accepting both protein sequence and structure as input. In this work, we present a depth analysis of six popular PLMs across model families and scales, spanning three training objectives, namely autoregressive, masked, and diffusion, and quantify how layer contributions evolve with depth using a unified set of probing- and perturbation-based measurements. Across all models, we observe consistent depth-dependent patterns that extend prior findings on LLMs: later layers depend less on earlier computations and mainly refine the final output distribution, and these effects are increasingly pronounced in deeper models.</description>

<title>Provable Last-Iterate Convergence for Multi-Objective Safe LLM Alignment via Optimistic Primal-Dual</title>

<guid>title:provable last iterate convergence for multi objective safe llm alignment via optimistic primal dual</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 17:54:52 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a significant role in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies.</description>

<description>In addition to the core tasks of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), active SLAM additionally in- volves generating robot actions that enable effective and efficient exploration of unknown environments. However, existing active SLAM pipelines are limited by three main factors. First, they inherit the restrictions of the underlying SLAM modules that they may be using. Second, their motion planning strategies are typically shortsighted and lack long-term vision. Third, most approaches struggle to handle dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel monocular active SLAM method, Dream-SLAM, which is based on dreaming cross-spatio-temporal images and semantically plausible structures of partially observed dynamic environments.</description>

<title>ExpLang: Improved Exploration and Exploitation in LLM Reasoning with On-Policy Thinking Language Selection</title>

<guid>title:explang improved exploration and exploitation in llm reasoning with on policy thinking language selection</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 13:10:58 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Current large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown strong ability on challenging tasks after reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training. However, previous work mainly focuses on English reasoning in expectation of the strongest performance, despite the demonstrated potential advantage of multilingual thinking, as well as the requirement for native thinking traces by global users. In this paper, we propose ExpLang, a novel LLM post-training pipeline that enables on-policy thinking language selection to improve exploration and exploitation during RL with the use of multiple languages. The results show that our method steadily outperforms English-only training with the same training budget, while showing high thinking language compliance for both seen and unseen languages. Analysis shows that, by enabling on-policy thinking language selection as an action during RL, ExpLang effectively extends the RL exploration space with diversified language preference and improves the RL exploitation outcome with leveraged non-English advantage. The method is orthogonal to most RL algorithms and opens up a new perspective on using multilinguality to improve LRMs.</description>

<description>Large language models consistently fail the &quot;car wash problem,&quot; a viral reasoning benchmark requiring implicit physical constraint inference. We present a variable isolation study (n=20 per condition, 6 conditions, 120 total trials) examining which prompt architecture layers in a production system enable correct reasoning. Using Claude 3. 5 Sonnet with controlled hyperparameters (temperature 0. 7, top_p 1. 0), we find that the STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) reasoning framework alone raises accuracy from 0% to 85% (p=0.</description>

<guid>title:dhp efficient scaling of mllm training with dynamic hybrid parallelism</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 11:11:53 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Scaling long-context capabilities is crucial for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, real-world multimodal datasets are extremely heterogeneous. Existing training frameworks predominantly rely on static parallelism strategies, which suffer from severe load imbalance, redundant communication, and suboptimal hardware utilization under data heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Parallelism (DHP), an efficient parallelism strategy that adaptively reconfigures communication groups and parallelism degrees during MLLM training. We generalize the non-power-of-two parallelism degrees and develop a polynomial-time algorithm to generate near-optimal parallelism strategies with only millisecond-level overhead per training batch. DHP is able to maintain high hardware efficiency even under extreme data variability.</description>

<guid>title:sigvlp sigmoid volume language pre training for self supervised ct volume adaptive representation learning</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 09:44:27 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large-scale, volumetric medical imaging datasets typically aggregate scans from different vendors and devices, resulting in highly variable resolution, slice thicknesses, and numbers of slices per study. Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly.</description>

<guid>title:explore on graph incentivizing autonomous exploration of large language models on knowledge graphs with path refined reward modeling</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 09:35:18 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The reasoning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often plagued by hallucinations and missing facts in question-answering tasks. A promising solution is to ground LLMs' answers in verifiable knowledge sources, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Prevailing KG-enhanced methods typically constrained LLM reasoning either by enforcing rules during generation or by imitating paths from a fixed set of demonstrations. However, they naturally confined the reasoning patterns of LLMs within the scope of prior experience or fine-tuning data, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution graph reasoning problems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Explore-on-Graph (EoG), a novel framework that encourages LLMs to autonomously explore a more diverse reasoning space on KGs. To incentivize exploration and discovery of novel reasoning paths, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning during training, whose reward is the correctness of the reasoning paths' final answers.</description>

<title>Hierarchical LLM-Based Multi-Agent Framework with Prompt Optimization for Multi-Robot Task Planning</title>

<guid>title:hierarchical llm based multi agent framework with prompt optimization for multi robot task planning</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 08:08:26 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multi-robot task planning requires decomposing natural-language instructions into executable actions for heterogeneous robot teams. Conventional Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners provide rigorous guarantees but struggle to handle ambiguous or long-horizon missions, while large language models (LLMs) can interpret instructions and propose plans but may hallucinate or produce infeasible actions. We present a hierarchical multi-agent LLM-based planner with prompt optimization: an upper layer decomposes tasks and assigns them to lower-layer agents, which generate PDDL problems solved by a classical planner. When plans fail, the system applies TextGrad-inspired textual-gradient updates to optimize each agent's prompt and thereby improve planning accuracy. In addition, meta-prompts are learned and shared across agents within the same layer, enabling efficient prompt optimization in multi-agent settings. On the MAT-THOR benchmark, our planner achieves success rates of 0.</description>

<title>PPCR-IM: A System for Multi-layer DAG-based Public Policy Consequence Reasoning and Social Indicator Mapping</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.21650</link>
<guid>title:ppcr im a system for multi layer dag based public policy consequence reasoning and social indicator mapping</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 07:23:20 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Public policy decisions are typically justified using a narrow set of headline indicators, leaving many downstream social impacts unstructured and difficult to compare across policies. We propose PPCR-IM, a system for multi-layer DAG-based consequence reasoning and social indicator mapping that addresses this gap. Given a policy description and its context, PPCR-IM uses an LLM-driven, layer-wise generator to construct a directed acyclic graph of intermediate consequences, allowing child nodes to have multiple parents to capture joint influences. A mapping module then aligns these nodes to a fixed indicator set and assigns one of three qualitative impact directions: increase, decrease, or ambiguous change. For each policy episode, the system outputs a structured record containing the DAG, indicator mappings, and three evaluation measures: an expected-indicator coverage score, a discovery rate for overlooked but relevant indicators, and a relative focus ratio comparing the systems coverage to that of the government. PPCR-IM is available both as an online demo and as a configurable XLSX-to-JSON batch pipeline.</description>

<guid>title:flowcorrect efficient interactive correction of generative flow policies for robotic manipulation</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 16:06:49 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Generative manipulation policies can fail catastrophically under deployment-time distribution shift, yet many failures are near-misses: the robot reaches almost-correct poses and would succeed with a small corrective motion. We present FlowCorrect, a deployment-time correction framework that converts near-miss failures into successes using sparse human nudges, without full policy retraining. During execution, a human provides brief corrective pose nudges via a lightweight VR interface. FlowCorrect uses these sparse corrections to locally adapt the policy, improving actions without retraining the backbone while preserving the model performance on previously learned scenarios. We evaluate on a real-world robot across three tabletop tasks: pick-and-place, pouring, and cup uprighting. With a low correction budget, FlowCorrect improves success on hard cases by 85\% while preserving performance on previously solved scenarios.</description>

<description>Recent work has examined language models from a linguistic perspective to better understand how they acquire language. Most existing benchmarks focus on judging grammatical acceptability, whereas the ability to interpret meanings conveyed by grammatical forms has received much less attention. We introduce the Linguistic Minimal-Pair Benchmark for Evaluating Constructional Understanding in Language Models (CxMP), a benchmark grounded in Construction Grammar that treats form-meaning pairings, or constructions, as fundamental linguistic units. CxMP evaluates whether models can interpret the semantic relations implied by constructions, using a controlled minimal-pair design across nine construction types, including the let-alone, caused motion, and ditransitive constructions. Our results show that while syntactic competence emerges early, constructional understanding develops more gradually and remains limited even in large language models (LLMs). CxMP thus reveals persistent gaps in how language models integrate form and meaning, providing a framework for studying constructional understanding and learning trajectories in language models.</description>

<guid>title:2 step agent a framework for the interaction of a decision maker with ai decision support</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 13:11:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Across a growing number of fields, human decision making is supported by predictions from AI models. However, we still lack a deep understanding of the effects of adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a general computational framework, the 2-Step Agent, which models the effects of AI-assisted decision making. Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support. Our results reveal several potential pitfalls of AI-driven decision support and highlight the need for thorough model documentation and proper user training.</description>

<guid>title:anthropic acquires vercept to advance claude s computer use capabilities</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 09:01:09 +0000</pubDate>
<description>People are using Claude for increasingly complex work—writing and running code across entire repositories, synthesizing research from dozens of sources, and managing workflows that span multiple tools and teams. Computer use enables Claude to do all of that inside live applications, the way a person at a keyboard would. That means Claude can take on multi-step tasks in live applications, and solve problems impossible with code alone. Today, we're announcing that Anthropic has acquired Vercept to help us push those capabilities further. Vercept was built around a clear thesis: making AI genuinely useful for completing complex tasks requires solving hard perception and interaction problems. The Vercept team—including co-founders Kiana Ehsani, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick—have spent years thinking carefully about how AI systems can see and act within the same software humans use every day.</description>

<title>Private and Robust Contribution Evaluation in Federated Learning</title>

<guid>title:private and robust contribution evaluation in federated learning</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 09:27:40 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Cross-silo federated learning allows multiple organizations to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data, but client updates can still leak sensitive information through inference attacks. Secure aggregation protects privacy by hiding individual updates, yet it complicates contribution evaluation, which is critical for fair rewards and detecting low-quality or malicious participants. Existing marginal-contribution methods, such as the Shapley value, are incompatible with secure aggregation, and practical alternatives, such as Leave-One-Out, are crude and rely on self-evaluation. We introduce two marginal-difference contribution scores compatible with secure aggregation. Fair-Private satisfies standard fairness axioms, while Everybody-Else eliminates self-evaluation and provides resistance to manipulation, addressing a largely overlooked vulnerability. We provide theoretical guarantees for fairness, privacy, robustness, and computational efficiency, and evaluate our methods on multiple medical image datasets and CIFAR10 in cross-silo settings.</description>

<guid>title:assessing airborne laser scanning and aerial photogrammetry for deep learning based stand delineation</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 09:16:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Accurate forest stand delineation is essential for forest inventory and management but remains a largely manual and subjective process. A recent study has shown that deep learning can produce stand delineations comparable to expert interpreters when combining aerial imagery and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. However, temporal misalignment between data sources limits operational scalability. Canopy height models (CHMs) derived from digital photogrammetry (DAP) offer better temporal alignment but may smoothen canopy surface and canopy gaps, raising the question of whether they can reliably replace ALS-derived CHMs. Similarly, the inclusion of a digital terrain model (DTM) has been suggested to improve delineation performance, but has remained untested in published literature. Using expert-delineated forest stands as reference data, we assessed a U-Net-based semantic segmentation framework with municipality-level cross-validation across six municipalities in southeastern Norway.</description>

<guid>title:space time forecasting of dynamic scenes with motion aware gaussian grouping</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 08:04:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Forecasting dynamic scenes remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, as limited observations make it difficult to capture coherent object-level motion and long-term temporal evolution. We present Motion Group-aware Gaussian Forecasting (MoGaF), a framework for long-term scene extrapolation built upon the 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. MoGaF introduces motion-aware Gaussian grouping and group-wise optimization to enforce physically consistent motion across both rigid and non-rigid regions, yielding spatially coherent dynamic representations. Leveraging this structured space-time representation, a lightweight forecasting module predicts future motion, enabling realistic and temporally stable scene evolution. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MoGaF consistently outperforms existing baselines in rendering quality, motion plausibility, and long-term forecasting stability.

<guid>title:neu pig neural preconditioned grids for fast dynamic surface reconstruction on long sequences</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 18:59:53 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Temporally consistent surface reconstruction of dynamic 3D objects from unstructured point cloud data remains challenging, especially for very long sequences. Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors.</description>

<title>Tokenizing Semantic Segmentation with RLE</title>

<guid>title:tokenizing semantic segmentation with rle</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 06:44:13 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This paper presents a new unified approach to semantic segmentation in both images and videos by using language modeling to output the masks as sequences of discrete tokens. We use run length encoding (RLE) to discretize the segmentation masks and then train a modified version of Pix2Seq \cite{p2s} to output these RLE tokens through autoregression. We propose novel tokenization strategies to compress the length of the token sequence to make it practicable to extend this approach to videos. We also show how instance information can be incorporated into the tokenization process to perform panoptic segmentation. We evaluate our proposed models on two datasets to show that they are competitive with the state of the art in spite of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources.</description>

<title>CoLoGen: Progressive Learning of Concept`-`Localization Duality for Unified Image Generation</title>

<guid>title:cologen progressive learning of concept localization duality for unified image generation</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 17:59:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Unified conditional image generation remains difficult because different tasks depend on fundamentally different internal representations. Some require conceptual understanding for semantic synthesis, while others rely on localization cues for spatial precision. Forcing these heterogeneous tasks to share a single representation leads to concept`-`localization representational conflict. To address this issue, we propose CoLoGen, a unified diffusion framework that progressively learns and reconciles this concept`-`localization duality. CoLoGen uses a staged curriculum that first builds core conceptual and localization abilities, then adapts them to diverse visual conditions, and finally refines their synergy for complex instruction`-`driven tasks. Central to this process is the Progressive Representation Weaving (PRW) module, which dynamically routes features to specialized experts and stably integrates their outputs across stages.</description>

<title>MedTri: A Platform for Structured Medical Report Normalization to Enhance Vision-Language Pretraining</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22143</link>
<guid>title:medtri a platform for structured medical report normalization to enhance vision language pretraining</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 17:49:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Medical vision-language pretraining increasingly relies on medical reports as large-scale supervisory signals; however, raw reports often exhibit substantial stylistic heterogeneity, variable length, and a considerable amount of image-irrelevant content. Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process.</description>

<guid>title:pseudo view enhancement via confidence fusion for unposed sparse view reconstruction</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 03:45:47 +0000</pubDate>
<description>3D scene reconstruction under unposed sparse viewpoints is a highly challenging yet practically important problem, especially in outdoor scenes due to complex lighting and scale variation. With extremely limited input views, directly utilizing diffusion model to synthesize pseudo frames will introduce unreasonable geometry, which will harm the final reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for sparse-view outdoor reconstruction that achieves high-quality results through bidirectional pseudo frame restoration and scene perception Gaussian management. Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional pseudo frame restoration method that restores missing content by diffusion-based synthesis guided by adjacent frames with a lightweight pseudo-view deblur model and confidence mask inference algorithm. Then we propose a scene perception Gaussian management strategy that optimize Gaussians based on joint depth-density information. These designs significantly enhance reconstruction completeness, suppress floating artifacts and improve overall geometric consistency under extreme view sparsity.</description>

<guid>title:gradalign gradient aligned data selection for llm reinforcement learning</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 01:54:50 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e. g. , accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum.</description>

<guid>title:detecting and preventing distillation attacks</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 09:01:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We have identified industrial-scale campaigns by three AI laboratories—DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax—to illicitly extract Claude’s capabilities to improve their own models. These labs generated over 16 million exchanges with Claude through approximately 24,000 fraudulent accounts, in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions. These labs used a technique called “distillation,” which involves training a less capable model on the outputs of a stronger one. Distillation is a widely used and legitimate training method. For example, frontier AI labs routinely distill their own models to create smaller, cheaper versions for their customers. But distillation can also be used for illicit purposes: competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently.</description>

<description>We’re releasing the third version of our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), the voluntary framework we use to mitigate catastrophic risks from AI systems. Anthropic has now had an RSP for more than two years, and we’ve learned a great deal about its benefits and its shortcomings. We’re therefore updating the policy to reinforce what has worked well to date, improve the policy where necessary, and implement new measures to increase the transparency and accountability of our decision-making. You can read the new RSP in full here . In this post, we’ll discuss some of the thinking behind the changes.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<title>Recursive Belief Vision Language Action Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20659</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.20659</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 20659v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Vision-language-action models must enable agents to execute long-horizon tasks under partial observability. However, most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. While semantic grounding is important, long-horizon manipulation fundamentally requires persistent, action-conditioned state representations. Current VLAs lack such representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control.</description>

<title>From Shadow AI to Enterprise Asset: A Seven-Layer Reference Architecture for Docker's AI Stack - The Deep Dive</title>

<guid>title:from shadow ai to enterprise asset a seven layer reference architecture for docker s ai stack the deep dive</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 08:58:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Introduction Most organizations are already using AI agents in their development workflows. The question is whether those agents are governed or fall under the category of 'shadow AI'. Without a strategic architecture, teams end up with unmanaged tool sprawl, inconsistent configurations, unclear security boundaries, and unpredictable cloud-inference bills. Docker's newer AI-focused building blocks can be composed into a repeatable, governed developer workflow that reduces developer friction while giving platform and security teams isolation, visibility, and policy enforcement at each layer. TL;DR The tables are a good place to start; from there, you can decide where to dive deeper. Note: For a high level summary of this blog post, see .</description>

<title>The persona selection model</title>
<link>https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dfoty34sT7CSKeJNn/the-persona-selection-model</link>
<guid>title:the persona selection model</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 22:56:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>TL;DR We describe the persona selection model (PSM): the idea that LLMs learn to simulate diverse characters during pre-training, and post-training elicits and refines a particular such Assistant &amp;nbsp;persona. Interactions with an AI assistant are then well-understood as being interactions with the Assistant—something roughly like a character in an LLM-generated story. We survey empirical behavioral, generalization, and interpretability-based evidence for PSM. PSM has consequences for AI development, such as recommending anthropomorphic reasoning about AI psychology and introduction of positive AI archetypes into training data. An important open question is how exhaustive PSM is, especially whether there might be sources of agency external to the Assistant persona, and how this might change in the future. Introduction What sort of thing is a modern AI assistant?</description>

<title>Project Vend: Phase two</title>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 09:00:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<description>In 2025, if you walked into any AI conference, you may hear the same gospel: faster inference, longer context windows, cheaper inference costs. It's as if we've spent years perfecting the hammer, making it lighter, stronger, more precisely balanced, while never questioning the fact that the carpenter still has only two hands and twenty-four hours in a day. Now, Kimi introduces Agent Swarm. It is not a better hammer. It is a reconstruction of the entire workshop.</description>

<guid>title:signs of introspection in large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 09:00:56 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Have you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so? Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability.</description>

<description>The Economic Research team studies how AI is reshaping the economy, including work, productivity, and economic opportunity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, we track AI's real-world economic effects and publish research that helps policymakers, businesses, and the public understand and prepare for the changes ahead. We build the empirical foundation for understanding AI's economic impact. Our flagship Anthropic Economic Index tracks how AI tools are actually being used around the world and across every sector of the economy—moving beyond speculation to measure adoption patterns as they unfold. Alongside our index reports, we produce novel research that studies the implications of AI usage and diffusion—as tracked in the index—for workers, for firms, and for the broader economy. Economic transitions create both opportunity and disruption.</description>

<description>Future AI systems will be even more powerful than today’s, likely in ways that break key assumptions behind current safety techniques. That’s why it’s important to develop sophisticated safeguards to ensure models remain helpful, honest, and harmless. The Alignment team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely. Alignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own. Alignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.</description>

<description>Our research teams investigate the safety, inner workings, and societal impacts of AI models – so that artificial intelligence has a positive impact as it becomes increasingly capable. The mission of the Interpretability team is to discover and understand how large language models work internally, as a foundation for AI safety and positive outcomes. The Alignment team works to understand the risks of AI models and develop ways to ensure that future ones remain helpful, honest, and harmless.</description>

<description>In many companies secure web gateways from providers like Zscaler, Cloudflare and Palo Alto Networks are applied between the computers of the employees and the Internet. These systems act as a “man-in-the-middle” route, inspecting the traffic between users and the Internet to filter URLs, protect against malware and control application access. These systems, operated mainly in the cloud, are decrypting and re-encrypting the HTTPS traffic and presenting a certificate to the client signed by a provider-controlled Certified Authority (CA). While the Operating System and most applications on the company computer are configured to trust the CA, other apps like developer tools might experience errors in validating these certificates. I had such issues when trying to pull a container image from Docker Hub using the Docker client in combination wit Colima and further when deploying some basic app to my local Kubernetes cluster using kind. ...</description>

<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 08:38:59 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Your OpenClaw agent is smart. It can browse the web, write code, manage files. But the moment you need it to call Stripe, or hit the GitHub API, or query a database, you're stuck pasting API keys into places they don't belong. This tutorial shows you how to set up AgentSecrets with OpenClaw so your agent can make authenticated API calls to any service, with your keys locked in your OS keychain where they belong. No . env files.</description>

<title>Mercury 2: The First Diffusion Model That 'Thinks'&quot;</title>
<link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqdf6Um_8OE</link>
<guid>title:mercury 2 the first diffusion model that thinks</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In this video, I test Inception's new Mercury 2, a diffusion-based large language model that introduces reasoning capabilities and generates text at 1,000 tokens per second. I demonstrate its speed and instruction-following through coding tests, and then evaluate its practical utility by integrating it into a real-time voice assistant and my open-source RAG agent.

<title>The Three Questions Every Startup Should Ask Before Building AI</title>

<guid>title:the three questions every startup should ask before building ai</guid>

<description>• Not all hard problems need ML—validate that adaptive learning actually solves your business problem before building. • Start with simple models (logistic regression, XGBoost) over cutting-edge architectures; prove concept viability first. • Data infrastructure matters as much as the model; invest in sourcing, labeling, and validation before training. • Build feedback loops and track real-world metrics from day one; plan for retraining and model iteration. • Calculate unit economics upfront—inference, training, and infrastructure costs must align with your business model to scale.

<title>Claude Code Remote Control</title>

<description>Claude Code Remote Control New Claude Code feature dropped yesterday: you can now run a &quot;remote control&quot; session on your computer and then use the Claude Code for web interfaces (on web, iOS and native desktop app) to send prompts to that session. It's a little bit janky right now. Initially when I tried it I got the error &quot;Remote Control is not enabled for your account. Contact your administrator. &quot; (but I am my administrator? ) - then I logged out and back into the Claude Code terminal app and it started working: claude remote-control You can only run one session on your machine at a time.</description>

<title>Quoting Benedict Evans</title>

<description>If people are only using this a couple of times a week at most, and can’t think of anything to do with it on the average day, it hasn’t changed their life. OpenAI itself admits the problem, talking about a ‘capability gap’ between what the models can do and what people do with them, which seems to me like a way to avoid saying that you don’t have clear product-market fit. Hence, OpenAI’s ad project is partly just about covering the cost of serving the 90% or more of users who don’t pay (and capturing an early lead with advertisers and early learning in how this might work), but more strategically, it’s also about making it possible to give those users the latest and most powerful (i. e. expensive) models, in the hope that this will deepen their engagement. &amp;mdash; Benedict Evans , How will OpenAI compete?</description>
