<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 09:00:49 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Anthropic and Infosys , a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting founded and headquartered in Bengaluru, today announced a collaboration to develop and deliver enterprise AI solutions across telecommunications, financial services, manufacturing, and software development. The collaboration integrates Anthropic's Claude models and Claude Code with Infosys Topaz , an AI-first set of services, solutions, and platforms using generative and agentic AI technologies, to help companies speed up software development and adopt AI with the governance and transparency that regulated industries require. India is the second-largest market for Claude.ai, home to a developer community doing some of the most technically intense AI work we see anywhere — nearly half of Claude usage in India involves building applications, modernizing systems, and shipping production software. Infosys is one of the first partners in Anthropic's expanded presence in India .</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<title>MEME: Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11918</link>
<guid>title:meme modeling the evolutionary modes of financial markets</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 13:16:05 +0000</pubDate>
<description>LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes.</description>

<title>Beyond End-to-End Video Models: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Educational Video Generation</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11790</link>
<guid>title:beyond end to end video models an llm based multi agent system for educational video generation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 10:14:36 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks.</description>

<title>Composition-RL: Compose Your Verifiable Prompts for Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.12036</link>
<guid>title:composition rl compose your verifiable prompts for reinforcement learning of large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 15:03:37 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large-scale verifiable prompts underpin the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but they contain many uninformative examples and are costly to expand further. Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with a pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into a new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that Composition-RL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset.</description>

<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:16:44 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations.</description>

<title>Move What Matters: Parameter-Efficient Domain Adaptation via Optimal Transport Flow for Collaborative Perception</title>

<guid>title:move what matters parameter efficient domain adaptation via optimal transport flow for collaborative perception</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:36:50 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Fast domain adaptation remains a fundamental challenge for deploying multi-agent systems across diverse environments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception. Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation.</description>

<title>Knowledge Integration Decay in Search-Augmented Reasoning of Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.09517</link>
<guid>title:knowledge integration decay in search augmented reasoning of large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:20:26 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks by employing search-augmented reasoning to incorporate external knowledge into long chains of thought. However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs.</description>

<title>SceneReVis: A Self-Reflective Vision-Grounded Framework for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Multi-turn RL</title>

<guid>title:scenerevis a self reflective vision grounded framework for 3d indoor scene synthesis via multi turn rl</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:55:56 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Current one-pass 3D scene synthesis methods often suffer from spatial hallucinations, such as collisions, due to a lack of deliberative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SceneReVis, a vision-grounded self-reflection framework that employs an iterative ``diagnose-and-act'' loop to explicitly intercept and resolve spatial conflicts using multi-modal feedback. To support this step-wise paradigm, we construct SceneChain-12k, a large-scale dataset of causal construction trajectories derived through a novel reverse engineering pipeline. We further propose a two-stage training recipe that transitions from Supervised Fine-Tuning to Agentic Reinforcement Learning, evolving the model into an active spatial planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneReVis achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity generation and goal-oriented optimization, with robust generalization to long-tail domains.</description>

<title>R2RAG-Flood: A reasoning-reinforced training-free retrieval augmentation generation framework for flood damage nowcasting</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.10312</link>
<guid>title:r2rag flood a reasoning reinforced training free retrieval augmentation generation framework for flood damage nowcasting</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 21:31:33 +0000</pubDate>
<description>R2RAG-Flood is a reasoning-reinforced, training-free retrieval-augmented generation framework for post-storm property damage nowcasting. Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0. 714 overall accuracy and 0.</description>

<title>ARK: A Dual-Axis Multimodal Retrieval Benchmark along Reasoning and Knowledge</title>

<guid>title:ark a dual axis multimodal retrieval benchmark along reasoning and knowledge</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 14:45:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks largely emphasize semantic matching on daily-life images and offer limited diagnostics of professional knowledge and complex reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks. We further show that simple enhancements such as re-ranking and rewriting yield consistent improvements, but substantial headroom remains.</description>

<title>Disentangling Ambiguity from Instability in Large Language Models: A Clinical Text-to-SQL Case Study</title>

<guid>title:disentangling ambiguity from instability in large language models a clinical text to sql case study</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 14:46:20 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Deploying large language models for clinical Text-to-SQL requires distinguishing two qualitatively different causes of output diversity: (i) input ambiguity that should trigger clarification, and (ii) model instability that should trigger human review. We propose CLUES, a framework that models Text-to-SQL as a two-stage process (interpretations --&gt; answers) and decomposes semantic uncertainty into an ambiguity score and an instability score. The instability score is computed via the Schur complement of a bipartite semantic graph matrix. Across AmbigQA/SituatedQA (gold interpretations) and a clinical Text-to-SQL benchmark (known interpretations), CLUES improves failure prediction over state-of-the-art Kernel Language Entropy. In deployment settings, it remains competitive while providing a diagnostic decomposition unavailable from a single score. The resulting uncertainty regimes map to targeted interventions - query refinement for ambiguity, model improvement for instability.</description>

<guid>title:flashvid efficient video large language models via training free tree based spatiotemporal token merging</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:56:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Although Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in video understanding, they are required to process high volumes of visual tokens, causing significant computational inefficiency. Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.</description>

<guid>title:multi task learning with additive u net for image denoising and classification</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 06:15:32 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We investigate additive skip fusion in U-Net architectures for image denoising and denoising-centric multi-task learning (MTL). By replacing concatenative skips with gated additive fusion, the proposed Additive U-Net (AddUNet) constrains shortcut capacity while preserving fixed feature dimensionality across depth. This structural regularization induces controlled encoder-decoder information flow and stabilizes joint optimization. Across single-task denoising and joint denoising-classification settings, AddUNet achieves competitive reconstruction performance with improved training stability. In MTL, learned skip weights exhibit systematic task-aware redistribution: shallow skips favor reconstruction, while deeper features support discrimination. Notably, reconstruction remains robust even under limited classification capacity, indicating implicit task decoupling through additive fusion.</description>

<guid>title:swe minisandbox container free reinforcement learning for building software engineering agents</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 02:33:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training software engineering (SWE) agents, but existing pipelines typically rely on per-task containers for isolation. At scale, pre-built container images incur substantial storage overhead, slow environment setup, and require container-management privileges. We propose SWE-MiniSandbox, a lightweight, container-free method that enables scalable RL training of SWE agents without sacrificing isolation. Instead of relying on per-instance containers, SWE-MiniSandbox executes each task in an isolated workspace backed by kernel-level mechanisms, substantially reducing system overhead. It leverages lightweight environment pre-caching techniques to eliminate the need for bulky container images. As a result, our approach lowers disk usage to approximately 5\% of that required by container-based pipelines and reduces environment preparation time to about 25\% of the container baseline.</description>

<guid>title:supervise assisted multi modality fusion diffusion model for pet restoration</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:06:48 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Positron emission tomography (PET) offers powerful functional imaging but involves radiation exposure. Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:04:32 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Backdoor attacks pose significant security risks for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the internal mechanisms by which triggers operate remain poorly understood. We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7. 5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0. 18 and 0.</description>

<title>Learning Self-Interpretation from Interpretability Artifacts: Training Lightweight Adapters on Vector-Label Pairs</title>

<guid>title:learning self interpretation from interpretability artifacts training lightweight adapters on vector label pairs</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 22:50:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Self-interpretation methods prompt language models to describe their own internal states, but remain unreliable due to hyperparameter sensitivity. We show that training lightweight adapters on interpretability artifacts, while keeping the LM entirely frozen, yields reliable self-interpretation across tasks and model families. A scalar affine adapter with just $d_\text{model}+1$ parameters suffices: trained adapters generate sparse autoencoder feature labels that outperform the training labels themselves (71% vs 63% generation scoring at 70B scale), identify topics with 94% recall@1 versus 1% for untrained baselines, and decode bridge entities in multi-hop reasoning that appear in neither prompt nor response, surfacing implicit reasoning without chain-of-thought. The learned bias vector alone accounts for 85% of improvement, and simpler adapters generalize better than more expressive alternatives. Controlling for model knowledge via prompted descriptions, we find self-interpretation gains outpace capability gains from 7B to 72B parameters. Our results demonstrate that self-interpretation improves with scale, without modifying the model being interpreted.</description>

<guid>title:towards reliable machine translation scaling llms for critical error detection and safety</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 23:47:39 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Machine Translation (MT) plays a pivotal role in cross-lingual information access, public policy communication, and equitable knowledge dissemination. However, critical meaning errors, such as factual distortions, intent reversals, or biased translations, can undermine the reliability, fairness, and safety of multilingual systems. In this work, we explore the capacity of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect such critical errors, evaluating models across a range of parameters using the publicly accessible data sets. Our findings show that model scaling and adaptation strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) yield consistent improvements, outperforming encoder-only baselines like XLM-R and ModernBERT. We argue that improving critical error detection in MT contributes to safer, more trustworthy, and socially accountable information systems by reducing the risk of disinformation, miscommunication, and linguistic harm, especially in high-stakes or underrepresented contexts. This work positions error detection not merely as a technical challenge, but as a necessary safeguard in the pursuit of just and responsible multilingual AI.</description>

<description>Language models have become practical tools for quantum computing education and research, from summarizing technical papers to explaining theoretical concepts and answering questions about recent developments in the field. While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%.</description>

<title>What, Whether and How? Unveiling Process Reward Models for Thinking with Images Reasoning</title>

<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 07:31:14 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The rapid advancement of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has demonstrated excellent abilities in various visual tasks. Building upon these developments, the thinking with images paradigm has emerged, enabling models to dynamically edit and re-encode visual information at each reasoning step, mirroring human visual processing. However, this paradigm introduces significant challenges as diverse errors may occur during reasoning processes. This necessitates Process Reward Models (PRMs) for distinguishing positive and negative reasoning steps, yet existing benchmarks for PRMs are predominantly text-centric and lack comprehensive assessment under this paradigm. To address these gaps, this work introduces the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating PRMs under the thinking with images paradigm. Our main contributions are: (1) Through extensive analysis of reasoning trajectories and guided search experiments with PRMs, we define 7 fine-grained error types and demonstrate both the necessity for specialized PRMs and the potential for improvement.</description>

<guid>title:a unified framework for multimodal image reconstruction and synthesis using denoising diffusion models</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 03:54:24 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Image reconstruction and image synthesis are important for handling incomplete multimodal imaging data, but existing methods require various task-specific models, complicating training and deployment workflows. We introduce Any2all, a unified framework that addresses this limitation by formulating these disparate tasks as a single virtual inpainting problem. We train a single, unconditional diffusion model on the complete multimodal data stack. This model is then adapted at inference time to ``inpaint'' all target modalities from any combination of inputs of available clean images or noisy measurements. We validated Any2all on a PET/MR/CT brain dataset. Our results show that Any2all can achieve excellent performance on both multimodal reconstruction and synthesis tasks, consistently yielding images with competitive distortion-based performance and superior perceptual quality over specialized methods.</description>

<guid>title:chamelion reliable change detection for long term lidar mapping in transient environments</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 01:15:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Online change detection is crucial for mobile robots to efficiently navigate through dynamic environments. Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations.</description>

<guid>title:interpretable vision transformers in image classification via svda</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:20:32 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification, yet their attention mechanisms often remain opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors. In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.</description>

<description>Embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet current methods rely on rigid templates to specify reasoning primitives (e. g. , objects in the scene, high-level plans, structural affordances). These templates can force policies to process irrelevant information that distracts from critical action-prediction signals. This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&amp;amp;B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 15:34:52 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2. 5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families.</description>

It leverages an ensemble of independently prompted evaluators guided by a human-aligned schema, supporting both discrete and continuous scoring judgement. With task-specific prompts from best candidate selection, summarization and image captioning to dialogue, MILE-RefHumEval provides flexible, interpretable, and scalable assessments. Experiments show it aligns closely with human judgments, outperforms prior methods, and reduces computational overhead, offering an efficient, robust, and human-aligned solution for real-world LLM evaluation.</description>

<description>The sparse Mixture of Experts(MoE) architecture has evolved as a powerful approach for scaling deep learning models to more parameters with comparable computation cost. As an important branch of large language model(LLM), MoE model only activate a subset of experts based on a routing network. This sparse conditional computation mechanism significantly improves computational efficiency, paving a promising path for greater scalability and cost-efficiency. It not only enhance downstream applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal in various horizontal domains, but also exhibit broad applicability across vertical domains. Despite the growing popularity and application of MoE models across various domains, there lacks a systematic exploration of recent advancements of MoE in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE suffer from limitations such as lack coverage or none extensively exploration of key areas.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:02:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Today's business organizations need access control systems that can handle complex, changing security requirements that go beyond what traditional methods can manage. Current approaches, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), were designed for specific purposes. They cannot effectively manage the dynamic, situation-dependent workflows that modern systems require. In this research, we introduce LLMAC, a new unified approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine these different access control methods into one comprehensive, understandable system. We used an extensive synthetic dataset that represents complex real-world scenarios, including policies for ownership verification, version management, workflow processes, and dynamic role separation. Using Mistral 7B, our trained LLM model achieved outstanding results with 98.</description>

<title>Stabilizing Physics-Informed Consistency Models via Structure-Preserving Training</title>

<guid>title:stabilizing physics informed consistency models via structure preserving training</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:40:19 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We propose a physics-informed consistency modeling framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) via fast, few-step generative inference. We identify a key stability challenge in physics-constrained consistency training, where PDE residuals can drive the model toward trivial or degenerate solutions, degrading the learned data distribution. To address this, we introduce a structure-preserving two-stage training strategy that decouples distribution learning from physics enforcement by freezing the coefficient decoder during physics-informed fine-tuning. We further propose a two-step residual objective that enforces physical consistency on refined, structurally valid generative trajectories rather than noisy single-step predictions. The resulting framework enables stable, high-fidelity inference for both unconditional generation and forward problems. We demonstrate that forward solutions can be obtained via a projection-based zero-shot inpainting procedure, achieving consistent accuracy of diffusion baselines with orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost.</description>

<title>WristMIR: Coarse-to-Fine Region-Aware Retrieval of Pediatric Wrist Radiographs with Radiology Report-Driven Learning</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.07872</link>
<guid>title:wristmir coarse to fine region aware retrieval of pediatric wrist radiographs with radiology report driven learning</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 08:57:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Retrieving wrist radiographs with analogous fracture patterns is challenging because clinically important cues are subtle, highly localized and often obscured by overlapping anatomy or variable imaging views. Progress is further limited by the scarcity of large, well-annotated datasets for case-based medical image retrieval. We introduce WristMIR, a region-aware pediatric wrist radiograph retrieval framework that leverages dense radiology reports and bone-specific localization to learn fine-grained, clinically meaningful image representations without any manual image-level annotations. Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0. 82% to 9.</description>

<guid>title:will reward seekers respond to distant incentives</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 19:35:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 16, 2026 7:35 PM GMT Reward-seekers are usually modeled as responding only to local incentives administered by developers. Here I ask: Will AIs or humans be able to influence their incentives at a distance—e. g. , by retroactively reinforcing actions substantially in the future or by committing to run many copies of them in simulated deployments with different incentives? If reward-seekers are responsive to distant incentives, it fundamentally changes the threat model, and is probably bad news for developers on balance. The core problem is asymmetric control: developers can relatively [1] tightly control local incentives—the reward signal during training and deployment—but they can't prevent distant actors from offering competing incentives.</description>

<title>MedScope: Incentivizing &quot;Think with Videos&quot; for Clinical Reasoning via Coarse-to-Fine Tool Calling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13332</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.13332</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 13332v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Long-form clinical videos are central to visual evidence-based decision-making, with growing importance for applications such as surgical robotics and related settings. However, current multimodal large language models typically process videos with passive sampling or weakly grounded inspection, which limits their ability to iteratively locate, verify, and justify predictions with temporally targeted evidence. To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite.</description>

<description>Published on February 15, 2026 2:20 AM GMT YouTube link In this episode, Guive Assadi argues that we should give AIs property rights, so that they are integrated in our system of property and come to rely on it. The claim is that this means that AIs would not kill or steal from humans, because that would undermine the whole property system, which would be extremely valuable to them. Topics we discuss: AI property rights Why not steal from and kill humans Why AIs may fear it could be them next AI retirement Could humans be upgraded to stay useful? Will AI progress continue? Why non-obsoletable AIs may still not end human property rights Why make AIs with property rights? Do property rights incentivize alignment?</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 08:47:16 +0000</pubDate>
<description>While building small AI utilities, I kept running into the same problem: agent frameworks felt heavy ad-hoc tool calling became messy workflows quickly turned into glue code I wanted something in between. So I built Kimten — a minimal micro-agent loop on top of the Vercel AI SDK. What Kimten is Kimten is a thin wrapper over the AI SDK Agent interface that gives you: a bounded agent loop (no infinite reasoning spirals) tool/function calling short-term conversation memory optional structured output via Zod predictable, minimal behavior No planners. No orchestration. No runtime magic. It’s meant to feel like a smart helper, not a framework.</description>

<title>Building Production-Ready RAG Systems with Free LLMs: From Zero to Analysis-Ready in 6 Steps</title>
<link>https://pub.towardsai.net/building-production-ready-rag-systems-with-free-llms-from-zero-to-analysis-ready-in-6-steps-9c4d215c619b?source=rss----98111c9905da---4</link>
<guid>title:building production ready rag systems with free llms from zero to analysis ready in 6 steps</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 04:51:47 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Introduction When I started exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for incident analysis, I realized that jumping straight into paid APIs like Claude or OpenAI wasn’t practical for learning and experimentation. Instead, I wanted to build something completely local , free to run , and powerful enough to handle real production scenarios . This article documents my journey building a fully functional RAG system that analyzes production incidents by learning from past issues — without spending a dime on API calls. Everything runs on a laptop using open-source tools. What You’ll Build By the end of this guide, you’ll understand how to build a working RAG system that: ✅ Learns from past incident data (your knowledge base) ✅ Performs semantic search on incident history (finds similar past issues) ✅ Analyzes new incidents using an open-source LLM (Llama 2) ✅ Suggests root causes and resolutions based on historical patterns ✅ Runs completely locally (no API keys, no cloud services) ✅ Produces analysis in 8–15 seconds per incident Real-World Use Case Imagine you have a production incident: New Issue: - Memory usage: 89% (baseline: 45%) - GC pause time: 2. 3 seconds (SLA: 200ms) - Cache lookups: 4x slower than normal - Error: OutOfMemoryError starting to appear Your RAG system will: Search through historical incidents Find that on January 15th, you had a similar issue (85% match) Retrieve the resolution that worked then (LRU cache eviction policy) Analyze the current incident with that context Provide a confidence-based recommendation That’s the power of RAG with local LLMs.</description>

<title>Two new Showboat tools: Chartroom and datasette-showboat</title>
<link>https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/17/chartroom-and-datasette-showboat/#atom-everything</link>
<guid>title:two new showboat tools chartroom and datasette showboat</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 00:43:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>I introduced Showboat a week ago - my CLI tool that helps coding agents create Markdown documents that demonstrate the code that they have created. I've been finding new ways to use it on a daily basis, and I've just released two new tools to help get the best out of the Showboat pattern. Chartroom is a CLI charting tool that works well with Showboat, and datasette-showboat lets Showboat's new remote publishing feature incrementally push documents to a Datasette instance. Showboat remote publishing datasette-showboat Chartroom How I built Chartroom The burgeoning Showboat ecosystem Showboat remote publishing I normally use Showboat in Claude Code for web (see note from this morning ). I've used it in several different projects in the past few days, each of them with a prompt that looks something like this: Use &quot;uvx showboat --help&quot; to perform a very thorough investigation of what happens if you use the Python sqlite-chronicle and sqlite-history-json libraries against the same SQLite database table Here's the resulting document . Just telling Claude Code to run uvx showboat --help is enough for it to learn how to use the tool - the help text is designed to work as a sort of ad-hoc Skill document.</description>

<title>Project Vend: Phase two</title>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 09:00:19 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<title>The best Apple Watch in 2026</title>
<link>https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-apple-watch-160005462.html?src=rss</link>
<guid>title:the best apple watch in 2026</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 08:00:36 +0000</pubDate>
<description>There are just three models of Apple Watch — and $500 separates the most affordable from the premium model, with the flagship landing somewhere in between. Before the launch of the overhauled Apple Watch SE 3 in late 2025, it was pretty easy to direct most people to the Apple Watch Series 11. But with its new display and faster charging, the budget model makes a lot more sense now. There’s also a case for recommending the refreshed Apple Watch Ultra 3 to diehard adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts. Here, we spell out just what differentiates the models as well as what you get when you buy any Apple Watch. Using insights gleaned from Engadget’s own reviews, this guide will help you pick the best Apple Watch for you.</description>

<description>Agentic AI in Action — Designing Guardrails for Agentic AI Without Stifling Innovation Agentic AI is steadily moving from experimentation into real enterprise systems. Unlike traditional automation or assistive AI, agentic systems do not simply respond to instructions. They observe context, reason over data, make decisions, and take action toward defined outcomes. This shift introduces a fundamental challenge. How do organizations allow AI systems to act autonomously while still maintaining trust, accountability, and control? The instinctive response is often to introduce more rules, more approvals, and more restrictions.</description>

<description>Article Authored By Bobby Tredinnick LMSW-CASAC ; CEO &amp;amp; Lead Clinician at Interactive Health Companies including Coast Health Consulting &amp;amp; Interactive International Solutions Created By OpenAI Clinicians across the field are exhausted. Not the kind of tired fixed with a weekend off. The kind that comes from spending two hours after every session writing notes, another hour answering emails, and realizing more time has been spent staring at screens than looking at the people they trained to help. When 93% of behavioral health workers report experiencing burnout, and a third of the workforce spends most of their time on administrative tasks instead of direct client support, the field is not dealing with individual resilience problems. It’s dealing with a structural failure in how behavioral health work gets done. The answer sitting in front of most clinicians right now is so obvious that it gets dismissed.</description>

<description>Given the threat of cognitive debt brought on by AI-accelerated software development leading to more projects and less deep understanding of how they work and what they actually do, it's interesting to consider artifacts that might be able to help. Nathan Baschez on Twitter : my current favorite trick for reducing &quot;cognitive debt&quot; (h/t @simonw ) is to ask the LLM to write two versions of the plan: The version for it (highly technical and detailed) The version for me (an entertaining essay designed to build my intuition) Works great This inspired me to try something new. I generated the diff between v0. 5. 0 and v0. 6.</description>

<description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but running them locally requires significant hardware resources. Many users rely on open-source models due to their accessibility, as closed source models often come with restrictive licensing and high costs. In this blog, I will explain how open-source LLMs function, using DeepSeek as an example. Installing Ollama and Running LLMs Locally To get started, you need to install Ollama , which provides an easy way to run and manage LLMs locally. Follow these steps: Download and install Ollama from the official website: https://ollama. com Or install via the command line: curl -fsSL https://ollama.</description>

<title>Rodney and Claude Code for Desktop</title>
<link>https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/16/rodney-claude-code/#atom-everything</link>
<guid>title:rodney and claude code for desktop</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 16:38:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>I'm a very heavy user of Claude Code on the web , Anthropic's excellent but poorly named cloud version of Claude Code where everything runs in a container environment managed by them, greatly reducing the risk of anything bad happening to a computer I care about. I don't use the web interface at all (hence my dislike of the name) - I access it exclusively through their native iPhone and Mac desktop apps. Something I particularly appreciate about the desktop app is that it lets you see images that Claude is &quot;viewing&quot; via its Read /path/to/image tool. Here's what that looks like: This means you can get a visual preview of what it's working on while it's working, without waiting for it to push code to GitHub for you to try out yourself later on. The prompt I used to trigger the above screenshot was: Run &quot;uvx rodney --help&quot; and then use Rodney to manually test the new pages and menu - look at screenshots from it and check you think they look OK I designed Rodney to have --help output that provides everything a coding agent needs to know in order to use the tool. The Claude iPhone app doesn't display opened images yet, so I requested it as a feature just now in a thread on Twitter.</description>
