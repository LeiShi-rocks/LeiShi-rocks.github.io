<title>1-Bit Wonder: Improving QAT Performance in the Low-Bit Regime through K-Means Quantization</title>

<guid>title:1 bit wonder improving qat performance in the low bit regime through k means quantization</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 13:23:26 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Quantization-aware training (QAT) is an effective method to drastically reduce the memory footprint of LLMs while keeping performance degradation at an acceptable level. However, the optimal choice of quantization format and bit-width presents a challenge in practice. The full design space of quantization is not fully explored in the context of QAT, and the precise trade-off between quantization and downstream performance is poorly understood, as comparisons often rely solely on perplexity-based evaluations. In this work, we address these shortcomings with an empirical study of QAT in the low-bit regime. We show that k-means based weight quantization outperforms integer formats and can be implemented efficiently on standard hardware. Furthermore, we find that, under a fixed inference memory budget, the best performance on generative downstream tasks is achieved with $1$-bit quantized weights.</description>

<title>Perceptive Humanoid Parkour: Chaining Dynamic Human Skills via Motion Matching</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.15827</link>
<guid>title:perceptive humanoid parkour chaining dynamic human skills via motion matching</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:59:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>While recent advances in humanoid locomotion have achieved stable walking on varied terrains, capturing the agility and adaptivity of highly dynamic human motions remains an open challenge. In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL.</description>

<guid>title:this human study did not involve human subjects validating llm simulations as behavioral evidence</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:18:38 +0000</pubDate>
<description>A growing literature uses large language models (LLMs) as synthetic participants to generate cost-effective and nearly instantaneous responses in social science experiments. However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses.</description>

<title>PERSONA: Dynamic and Compositional Inference-Time Personality Control via Activation Vector Algebra</title>

<guid>title:persona dynamic and compositional inference time personality control via activation vector algebra</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 15:47:58 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Current methods for personality control in Large Language Models rely on static prompting or expensive fine-tuning, failing to capture the dynamic and compositional nature of human traits. We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9. 60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.</description>

<title>STAPO: Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning for LLMs by Silencing Rare Spurious Tokens</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.15620</link>
<guid>title:stapo stabilizing reinforcement learning for llms by silencing rare spurious tokens</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 14:46:48 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has significantly improved large language model reasoning, but existing RL fine-tuning methods rely heavily on heuristic techniques such as entropy regularization and reweighting to maintain stability. In practice, they often experience late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. We derive that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. Building on this result, we prove that training instability is driven by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0. 01\%, which we term \emph{spurious tokens}. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates.</description>

<title>The geometry of online conversations and the causal antecedents of conflictual discourse</title>

<guid>title:the geometry of online conversations and the causal antecedents of conflictual discourse</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 14:12:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This article investigates the causal antecedents of conflictual language and the geometry of interaction in online threaded conversations related to climate change. We employ three annotation dimensions, inferred through LLM prompting and averaging, to capture complementary aspects of discursive conflict (such as stance: agreement vs disagreement; tone: attacking vs respectful; and emotional versus factual framing) and use data from a threaded online forum to examine how these dimensions respond to temporal, conversational, and arborescent structural features of discussions. We show that, as suggested by the literature, longer delays between successive posts in a thread are associated with replies that are, on average, more respectful, whereas longer delays relative to the parent post are associated with slightly less disagreement but more emotional (less factual) language. Second, we characterize alignment with the local conversational environment and find strong convergence both toward the average stance, tone and emotional framing of older sibling posts replying to the same parent and toward those of the parent post itself, with parent post effects generally stronger than sibling effects. We further show that early branch-level responses condition these alignment dynamics, such that parent-child stance alignment is amplified or attenuated depending on whether a branch is initiated in agreement or disagreement with the discussion's root message. These influences are largely additive for civility-related dimensions (attacking vs respectful, disagree vs agree), whereas for emotional versus factual framing there is a significant interaction: alignment with the parent's emotionality is amplified when older siblings are similarly aligned.</description>

<pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 08:58:38 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The Government of Rwanda and Anthropic have signed a three-year Memorandum of Understanding to formalize and expand our partnership, bringing AI to Rwanda’s education, health, and public sector systems. This agreement builds on the ALX education partnership we announced in November 2025 and marks the first time Anthropic has formalized a multi-sector partnership through a government MOU on the African continent. Our collaboration spans three areas: “This partnership with Anthropic is an important milestone in Rwanda’s AI journey. Our goal is to continue to design and deploy AI solutions that can be applied at a national level to strengthen education, advance health outcomes, and enhance governance with an emphasis on our context,” said Paula Ingabire, Minister of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Innovation in Rwanda.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<title>LLM-as-Judge on a Budget</title>

<guid>title:llm as judge on a budget</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 10:35:41 +0000</pubDate>
<description>LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as a cornerstone technique for evaluating large language models by leveraging LLM reasoning to score prompt-response pairs. Since LLM judgments are stochastic, practitioners commonly query each pair multiple times to estimate mean scores accurately. This raises a critical challenge: given a fixed computational budget $B$, how to optimally allocate queries across $K$ prompt-response pairs to minimize estimation error? % We present a principled variance-adaptive approach leveraging multi-armed bandit theory and concentration inequalities. Our method dynamically allocates queries based on estimated score variances, concentrating resources where uncertainty is highest. Further, our algorithm is shown to achieve a worst-case score-estimation error of $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^K σ_i^2}{B}}\right)$, $σ_i^2$ being the unknown score variance for pair $i \in [K]$ with near-optimal budget allocation.</description>

<guid>title:gaiaflow semantic guided diffusion tuning for carbon frugal search</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 08:35:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>As the burgeoning power requirements of sophisticated neural architectures escalate, the information retrieval community has recognized ecological sustainability as a pivotal priority that necessitates a fundamental paradigm shift in model design. While contemporary neural rankers have attained unprecedented accuracy, the substantial environmental externalities associated with their computational intensity often remain overlooked in large-scale deployments. We present GaiaFlow, an innovative framework engineered to facilitate carbon-frugal search by operationalizing semantic-guided diffusion tuning. Our methodology orchestrates the convergence of retrieval-guided Langevin dynamics and a hardware-independent performance modeling strategy to optimize the trade-off between search precision and environmental preservation. By incorporating adaptive early exit protocols and precision-aware quantized inference, the proposed architecture significantly mitigates operational carbon footprints while maintaining robust retrieval quality across heterogeneous computing infrastructures. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that GaiaFlow achieves a superior equilibrium between effectiveness and energy efficiency, offering a scalable and sustainable pathway for next-generation neural search systems.</description>

<title>The Geometry of Alignment Collapse: When Fine-Tuning Breaks Safety</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.15799</link>
<guid>title:the geometry of alignment collapse when fine tuning breaks safety</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:39:15 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Fine-tuning aligned language models on benign tasks unpredictably degrades safety guardrails, even when training data contains no harmful content and developers have no adversarial intent. We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is structurally unstable and collapses under the dynamics of gradient descent. We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters.</description>

<description>Evaluating the quality of automatically generated text often relies on LLM-as-a-judge (LLM-judge) methods. While effective, these approaches are computationally expensive and require post-processing. To address these limitations, we build upon ParaPLUIE, a perplexity-based LLM-judge metric that estimates confidence over ``Yes/No'' answers without generating text. We introduce *-PLUIE, task specific prompting variants of ParaPLUIE and evaluate their alignment with human judgement. Our experiments show that personalised *-PLUIE achieves stronger correlations with human ratings while maintaining low computational cost.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:01:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) are often used to answer questions in structured data such as tables in Markdown, JSON, and images. While these models can often give correct answers, users also need to know where those answers come from. In this work, we study structured data attribution/citation, which is the ability of the models to point to the specific rows and columns that support an answer. We evaluate several mLLMs across different table formats and prompting strategies. Our results show a clear gap between question answering and evidence attribution. Although question answering accuracy remains moderate, attribution accuracy is much lower, near random for JSON inputs, across all models.</description>

<title>Beyond Binary Classification: Detecting Fine-Grained Sexism in Social Media Videos</title>

<guid>title:beyond binary classification detecting fine grained sexism in social media videos</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 17:45:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Online sexism appears in various forms, which makes its detection challenging. Although automated tools can enhance the identification of sexist content, they are often restricted to binary classification. Consequently, more subtle manifestations of sexism may remain undetected due to the lack of fine-grained, context-sensitive labels. To address this issue, we make the following contributions: (1) we present FineMuSe, a new multimodal sexism detection dataset in Spanish that includes both binary and fine-grained annotations; (2) we introduce a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy that encompasses forms of sexism, non-sexism, and rhetorical devices of irony and humor; and (3) we evaluate a wide range of LLMs for both binary and fine-grained sexism detection. Our findings indicate that multimodal LLMs perform competitively with human annotators in identifying nuanced forms of sexism; however, they struggle to capture co-occurring sexist types when these are conveyed through visual cues.</description>

Existing interpretability methods often highlight tokens or spans correlated with an answer, but they rarely reveal where the model makes consequential reasoning turns, which earlier context causally triggers those turns, or whether the highlighted text actually steers the reasoning process. We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score. We also compute turning-angle curvature changes on raw logits as a complementary diagnostic and introduce curvature signatures to summarize shared intervention-response geometry.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Assessing human muscle fatigue is critical for optimizing performance and safety in physical human-robot interaction(pHRI). This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:00:08 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Neural networks can accurately forecast complex dynamical systems, yet how they internally represent underlying latent geometry remains poorly understood. We study neural forecasters through the lens of representational alignment, introducing anchor-based, geometry-agnostic relative embeddings that remove rotational and scaling ambiguities in latent spaces. Applying this framework across seven canonical dynamical systems - ranging from periodic to chaotic - we reveal reproducible family-level structure: multilayer perceptrons align with other MLPs, recurrent networks with RNNs, while transformers and echo-state networks achieve strong forecasts despite weaker alignment. Alignment generally correlates with forecasting accuracy, yet high accuracy can coexist with low alignment. Relative geometry thus provides a simple, reproducible foundation for comparing how model families internalize and represent dynamical structure.</description>

<description>The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background).</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 12:15:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The LLM community often reports benchmark results as if they are synonymous with general model capabilities. However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance. Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:59:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Fair scores reward ensemble forecast members that behave like samples from the same distribution as the verifying observations. They are therefore an attractive choice as loss functions to train data-driven ensemble forecasts or post-processing methods when large training ensembles are either unavailable or computationally prohibitive. The adjusted continuous ranked probability score (aCRPS) is fair and unbiased with respect to ensemble size, provided forecast members are exchangeable and interpretable as conditionally independent draws from an underlying predictive distribution. However, distribution-aware post-processing methods that introduce structural dependency between members can violate this assumption, rendering aCRPS unfair. We demonstrate this effect using two approaches designed to minimize the expected aCRPS of a finite ensemble: (1) a linear member-by-member calibration, which couples members through a common dependency on the sample ensemble mean, and (2) a deep-learning method, which couples members via transformer self-attention across the ensemble dimension. In both cases, the results are sensitive to ensemble size and apparent gains in aCRPS can correspond to systematic unreliability characterized by over-dispersion.</description>

<guid>title:automated multi source debugging and natural language error explanation for dashboard applications</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:06:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Modern web dashboards and enterprise applications increasingly rely on complex, distributed microservices architectures. While these architectures offer scalability, they introduce significant challenges in debugging and observability. When failures occur, they often manifest as opaque error messages to the end-user such as Something went wrong. This masks the underlying root cause which may reside in browser side exceptions, API contract violations, or server side logic failures. Existing monitoring tools capture these events in isolation but fail to correlate them effectively or provide intelligible explanations to non technical users. This paper proposes a novel system for Automated Multi Source Debugging and Natural Language Error Explanation.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 04:33:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) force rapid topology changes that can render standard operating points infeasible, requiring operators to quickly identify corrective transmission switching actions that reduce load shedding while maintaining acceptable voltage behavior. We present a verifiable, multi-stage adaptation pipeline that fine-tunes an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) to generate \emph{open-only} corrective switching plans from compact PSPS scenario summaries under an explicit switching budget. First, supervised fine-tuning distills a DC-OPF MILP oracle into a constrained action grammar that enables reliable parsing and feasibility checks. Second, direct preference optimization refines the policy using AC-evaluated preference pairs ranked by a voltage-penalty metric, injecting voltage-awareness beyond DC imitation. Finally, best-of-$N$ selection provides an inference-time addition by choosing the best feasible candidate under the target metric. On IEEE 118-bus PSPS scenarios, fine-tuning substantially improves DC objective values versus zero-shot generation, reduces AC power-flow failure from 50\% to single digits, and improves voltage-penalty outcomes on the common-success set.</description>

<title>Neural Scaling Laws for Boosted Jet Tagging</title>

<guid>title:neural scaling laws for boosted jet tagging</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:13:01 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established that scaling compute, through joint increases in model capacity and dataset size, is the primary driver of performance in modern machine learning. While machine learning has long been an integral component of High Energy Physics (HEP) data analysis workflows, the compute used to train state-of-the-art HEP models remains orders of magnitude below that of industry foundation models. With scaling laws only beginning to be studied in the field, we investigate neural scaling laws for boosted jet classification using the public JetClass dataset. We derive compute optimal scaling laws and identify an effective performance limit that can be consistently approached through increased compute. We study how data repetition, common in HEP where simulation is expensive, modifies the scaling yielding a quantifiable effective dataset size gain. We then study how the scaling coefficients and asymptotic performance limits vary with the choice of input features and particle multiplicity, demonstrating that increased compute reliably drives performance toward an asymptotic limit, and that more expressive, lower-level features can raise the performance limit and improve results at fixed dataset size.</description>

<title>ER-MIA: Black-Box Adversarial Memory Injection Attacks on Long-Term Memory-Augmented Large Language Models</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 04:19:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with long-term memory systems to overcome finite context windows and enable persistent reasoning across interactions. However, recent research finds that LLMs become more vulnerable because memory provides extra attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of black-box adversarial memory injection attacks that target the similarity-based retrieval mechanism in long-term memory-augmented LLMs. We introduce ER-MIA, a unified framework that exposes this vulnerability and formalizes two realistic attack settings: content-based attacks and question-targeted attacks. In these settings, ER-MIA includes an arsenal of composable attack primitives and ensemble attacks that achieve high success rates under minimal attacker assumptions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and long-term memory systems demonstrate that similarity-based retrieval constitutes a fundamental and system-level vulnerability, revealing security risks that persist across memory designs and application scenarios.</description>

<description>Low-resource languages pose persistent challenges for Natural Language Processing tasks such as lemmatization and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. This paper investigates the capacity of recent large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 variants and open-weight Mistral models, to address these tasks in few-shot and zero-shot settings for four historically and linguistically diverse under-resourced languages: Ancient Greek, Classical Armenian, Old Georgian, and Syriac. Using a novel benchmark comprising aligned training and out-of-domain test corpora, we evaluate the performance of foundation models across lemmatization and POS-tagging, and compare them with PIE, a task-specific RNN baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, even without fine-tuning, achieve competitive or superior performance in POS-tagging and lemmatization across most languages in few-shot settings. Significant challenges persist for languages characterized by complex morphology and non-Latin scripts, but we demonstrate that LLMs are a credible and relevant option for initiating linguistic annotation tasks in the absence of data, serving as an effective aid for annotation.</description>

<title>Language and Geometry Grounded Sparse Voxel Representations for Holistic Scene Understanding</title>

<guid>title:language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations for holistic scene understanding</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 17:10:13 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Existing 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding methods mostly emphasize distilling language features from 2D foundation models into 3D feature fields, but largely overlook the synergy among scene appearance, semantics, and geometry. As a result, scene understanding often deviates from the underlying geometric structure of scenes and becomes decoupled from the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations to comprehensively model appearance, semantics, and geometry within a unified framework. Specifically, we use 3D sparse voxels as primitives and employ an appearance field, a density field, a feature field, and a confidence field to holistically represent a 3D scene. To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:45:15 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Node embeddings map graph vertices into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces while preserving structural information. They are central to tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and signal reconstruction. A key goal is to design node embeddings whose dot products capture meaningful notions of node similarity induced by the graph. Graph kernels offer a principled way to define such similarities, but their direct computation is often prohibitive for large networks. Inspired by random feature methods for kernel approximation in Euclidean spaces, we introduce randomized spectral node embeddings whose dot products estimate a low-rank approximation of any specific graph kernel. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that our embeddings achieve more accurate kernel approximations than existing methods, particularly for spectrally localized kernels.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 02:46:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has gained increasing attention in medical imaging as a way to identify abnormalities without task-specific supervision, but most advances remain limited to 2D datasets. Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision. Our results show that training-free, batch-based ZSAD can be effectively extended from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 02:44:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>AI Memory, specifically how models organizes and retrieves historical messages, becomes increasingly valuable to Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing methods (RAG and Graph-RAG) primarily retrieve memory through similarity-based mechanisms. While efficient, such System-1-style retrieval struggles with scenarios that require global reasoning or comprehensive coverage of all relevant information. In this work, We propose Mnemis, a novel memory framework that integrates System-1 similarity search with a complementary System-2 mechanism, termed Global Selection. Mnemis organizes memory into a base graph for similarity retrieval and a hierarchical graph that enables top-down, deliberate traversal over semantic hierarchies. By combining the complementary strength from both retrieval routes, Mnemis retrieves memory items that are both semantically and structurally relevant. Mnemis achieves state-of-the-art performance across all compared methods on long-term memory benchmarks, scoring 93.</description>

<description>As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly integrates into crowdfunding practices, strategic disclosure of AI involvement has become critical. Yet, empirical insights into how different disclosure strategies influence investor decisions remain limited. Drawing on signaling theory and Aristotle's rhetorical framework, we examine how mandatory AI disclosure affects crowdfunding performance and how substantive signals (degree of AI involvement) and rhetorical signals (logos/explicitness, ethos/authenticity, pathos/emotional tone) moderate these effects. Leveraging Kickstarter's mandatory AI disclosure policy as a natural experiment and four supplementary online experiments, we find that mandatory AI disclosure significantly reduces crowdfunding performance: funds raised decline by 39. 8% and backer counts by 23. 9% for AI-involved projects.</description>

<description>Image by Author Section 1: Technical &amp;amp; Hands-On (ML/AI &amp;amp; MLOps) These questions test your foundational knowledge of MLOps, regardless of the cloud platform. 1. Describe the most complex ML project you’ve taken from R&amp;amp;D to production. What was your role in each stage? Answer: The most complex project I led was a real-time fraud detection system for a financial institution. In the R&amp;amp;D phase, I collaborated with data scientists to select the optimal model architecture and validate its performance.</description>

<title>Toward Scalable Verifiable Reward: Proxy State-Based Evaluation for Multi-turn Tool-Calling LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16246</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.16246</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 16246v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Interactive large language model (LLM) agents operating via multi-turn dialogue and multi-step tool calling are increasingly used in production. Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e. g. , tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate.</description>

<description>1. Introduction: Beyond Automation to Autonomy The Current State: The Wall of Monitors and the War Room The alert fires at 2:17 AM. A cascade of notifications lights up the on-call engineer’s phone, each a symptom of a deeper, unseen problem. What follows is a familiar, frantic ritual of modern operations. A digital war room is convened in Slack, pulling engineers from their sleep into a flurry of activity. One engineer pores over Datadog dashboards, trying to correlate a spike in API latency with memory usage.</description>

<pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 04:48:47 +0000</pubDate>
<description>SWE-bench February 2026 leaderboard update SWE-bench is one of the benchmarks that the labs love to list in their model releases. The official leaderboard is infrequently updated but they just did a full run of it against the current generation of models, which is notable because it's always good to see benchmark results like this that weren't self-reported by the labs. The fresh results are for their &quot;Bash Only&quot; benchmark, which runs their mini-swe-bench agent (~9,000 lines of Python, here are the prompts they use) against the SWE-bench dataset of coding problems - 2,294 real-world examples pulled from 12 open source repos: django/django (850), sympy/sympy (386), scikit-learn/scikit-learn (229), sphinx-doc/sphinx (187), matplotlib/matplotlib (184), pytest-dev/pytest (119), pydata/xarray (110), astropy/astropy (95), pylint-dev/pylint (57), psf/requests (44), mwaskom/seaborn (22), pallets/flask (11). Here's how the top ten models performed: It's interesting to see Claude Opus 4. 5 beat Opus 4. 6, though only by about a percentage point.</description>

<description>A benchmark for evaluating atomic visual world knowledge in Multimodal LLMs. Authors Kimi Team We are releasing WorldVQA , a new benchmark designed to measure the factual correctness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While recent models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in visual reasoning and description, measuring their reliability regarding visual world knowledge remains a challenge.</description>

<description>I built an open-source engine with 22 detectors, a DeBERTa classifier, ensemble scoring, and a self-hardening feedback loop. Here’s how it works and why I think it matters. Let me tell you something that keeps me up at night. We’re shipping LLM-powered apps at a pace that would’ve seemed absurd three years ago — chatbots, internal tools, AI agents that read your email and book your meetings. And the security story for most of these apps is… basically nothing. Maybe a regex that blocks “ignore previous instructions.</description>

<title>Project Vend: Phase two</title>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 08:58:14 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<description>I've spent the last year paying per-token overages on Claude Code because I keep hitting my weekly limit. That's not a complaint. That's context. I use Claude Code the way most developers eventually do — as a headless collaborator running in the background while I do other things. The problem is &quot;other things&quot; often means I'm not at my computer. I'd come back 40 minutes later to find Claude had been waiting on me for 35 of them.</description>

<title>Will reward-seekers respond to distant incentives?</title>
<link>https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/8cyjgrTSxGNdghesE/will-reward-seekers-respond-to-distant-incentives</link>
<guid>title:will reward seekers respond to distant incentives</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 19:35:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 16, 2026 7:35 PM GMT Reward-seekers are usually modeled as responding only to local incentives administered by developers. Here I ask: Will AIs or humans be able to influence their incentives at a distance—e. g. , by retroactively reinforcing actions substantially in the future or by committing to run many copies of them in simulated deployments with different incentives? If reward-seekers are responsive to distant incentives, it fundamentally changes the threat model, and is probably bad news for developers on balance. The core problem is asymmetric control: developers can relatively [1] tightly control local incentives—the reward signal during training and deployment—but they can't prevent distant actors from offering competing incentives.</description>

<description>We are welcoming you to our weekly digest! Here, we discuss the latest trends and advancements in account abstraction, chain abstraction and everything related, as well as bring some insights from Etherspot’s kitchen. The latest news we'll cover: Vitalik Reframes Ethereum’s Role in AI Around Privacy, Trust and Governance L2 Interop WG #19 Highlights EIP-7702 + 5792 Cross-Chain UX Robinhood Launches Public Testnet for Robinhood Chain OWASP Forecasts 2026’s Most Critical Smart Contract Vulnerabilities Please fasten your belts! Vitalik Reframes Ethereum's Role in AI Around Privacy, Trust and Governance Vitalik Buterin revisited his 2024 essay on crypto and AI intersections, arguing that discussions around AGI often frame progress as undifferentiated acceleration rather than a conscious choice of direction. He emphasized that Ethereum’s role is not simply to “work on AGI,” but to help steer AI development toward human freedom, decentralization, and defense-oriented outcomes. He outlined four priority areas in his updated framework.</description>

<title>Securing the Autonomous Frontier: A Guide to AI Identity</title>

<description>Imagine an AI agent, tasked with “optimizing cloud costs,” deciding that the most efficient path is to delete an underutilized production database. In the shift toward 2026, we’ve moved from simple chat interfaces to Agentic AI — systems that don’t just talk, but actually act . This leap in productivity brings a fundamental challenge: Traditional identity management is no longer enough . To secure the modern enterprise, we must treat AI agents not as simple applications, but as first-class identities with their own governance and guardrails. 1. The New Security Frontier: Why Traditional Identity Fails Historically, Identity and Access Management (IAM) was built for two types of actors: Humans (using passwords and MFA) and Service Accounts (using static secrets for predictable background tasks).</description>

<description>Prompt engineering gets you a demo. Context engineering gets you a product. Here’s the architecture I use across every agent I build. The Shift Nobody Warned Me About For the past year, I’ve been building AI agents professionally — for myself and for clients. Trading agents, email assistants, calendar bots, research tools. And the single biggest improvement in agent quality didn’t come from a better model, a smarter prompt, or a new framework.</description>

<title>AXRP Episode 48 - Guive Assadi on AI Property Rights</title>
<link>https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4foFK5Lz65ywSz4eo/axrp-episode-48-guive-assadi-on-ai-property-rights</link>

<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Published on February 15, 2026 2:20 AM GMT YouTube link In this episode, Guive Assadi argues that we should give AIs property rights, so that they are integrated in our system of property and come to rely on it. The claim is that this means that AIs would not kill or steal from humans, because that would undermine the whole property system, which would be extremely valuable to them. Topics we discuss: AI property rights Why not steal from and kill humans Why AIs may fear it could be them next AI retirement Could humans be upgraded to stay useful? Will AI progress continue? Why non-obsoletable AIs may still not end human property rights Why make AIs with property rights? Do property rights incentivize alignment?</description>

<title>The A.I. Disruption We’ve Been Waiting for Has Arrived</title>

<description>The A. I. Disruption We’ve Been Waiting for Has Arrived New opinion piece from Paul Ford in the New York Times. Unsurprisingly for a piece by Paul it's packed with quoteworthy snippets, but a few stood out for me in particular. Paul describes the November moment that so many other programmers have observed, and highlights Claude Code's ability to revive old side projects: [Claude Code] was always a helpful coding assistant, but in November it suddenly got much better, and ever since I’ve been knocking off side projects that had sat in folders for a decade or longer. It’s fun to see old ideas come to life, so I keep a steady flow.</description>

<title>SPOKE: A massive biomedical knowledge graph for precision health and drug discovery</title>

<guid>title:spoke a massive biomedical knowledge graph for precision health and drug discovery</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 01:15:18 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Massive amounts of data and information are available for analysis in biomedicine. However, integrating these resources in a powerful statistical framework that is also biologically meaningful poses a considerable challenge. SPOKE is a large knowledge graph containing information from more than 40 specialized databases and spanning multiple disciplines within biomedicine. Currently, SPOKE contains approximately 50 million concepts and over 130 million relationships, organized in a semantic graph. This talk will cover the creation of SPOKE and some of its cutting-edge applications. Some examples include the embedding of more than 2 million electronic health records onto SPOKE, which enabled the training of machine learning models to predict diagnoses and outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).</description>
