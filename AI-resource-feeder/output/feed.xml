<description>AI will bring enormous benefits —for science, technology, medicine, economic growth, and much more. But a technology this powerful also comes with considerable risks . Those risks might come from the misuse of the models: AI is already being exploited to automate cyberattacks ; in the future it might assist in the production of dangerous weapons . Risks might also come from the models themselves: powerful AI systems can take harmful actions contrary to the intentions—and out of the control—of their users. AI models are improving in their capabilities at a dizzying, increasing pace , from simple chatbots in 2023 to today’s “agents” that complete complex tasks. At Anthropic, we’ve had to redesign a notoriously difficult technical test for hiring software engineers multiple times as successive AI models defeated each version.</description>

<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:30:20 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Embodied navigation has long been fragmented by task-specific architectures. We introduce ABot-N0, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model that achieves a ``Grand Unification'' across 5 core tasks: Point-Goal, Object-Goal, Instruction-Following, POI-Goal, and Person-Following. ABot-N0 utilizes a hierarchical ``Brain-Action'' architecture, pairing an LLM-based Cognitive Brain for semantic reasoning with a Flow Matching-based Action Expert for precise, continuous trajectory generation. To support large-scale learning, we developed the ABot-N0 Data Engine, curating 16. 9M expert trajectories and 5. 0M reasoning samples across 7,802 high-fidelity 3D scenes (10.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<title>Beyond End-to-End Video Models: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Educational Video Generation</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11790</link>
<guid>title:beyond end to end video models an llm based multi agent system for educational video generation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 10:14:36 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks.</description>

<title>Benchmark Illusion: Disagreement among LLMs and Its Scientific Consequences</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11898</link>
<guid>title:benchmark illusion disagreement among llms and its scientific consequences</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 12:53:39 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Benchmarks underpin how progress in large language models (LLMs) is measured and trusted. Yet our analyses reveal that apparent convergence in benchmark accuracy can conceal deep epistemic divergence. Using two major reasoning benchmarks - MMLU-Pro and GPQA - we show that LLMs achieving comparable accuracy still disagree on 16-66% of items, and 16-38% among top-performing frontier models. These discrepancies suggest distinct error profiles for different LLMs. When such models are used for scientific data annotation and inference, their hidden disagreements propagate into research results: in re-analyses of published studies in education and political science, switching the annotation model can change estimated treatment effects by more than 80%, and in some cases reverses their sign. Together, these findings illustrate a benchmark illusion, where equal accuracy may conceal disagreement, with model choice becoming a hidden yet consequential variable for scientific reproducibility.</description>

<title>Seq2Seq2Seq: Lossless Data Compression via Discrete Latent Transformers and Reinforcement Learning</title>

<guid>title:seq2seq2seq lossless data compression via discrete latent transformers and reinforcement learning</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:30:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format.</description>

<title>Who Does What? Archetypes of Roles Assigned to LLMs During Human-AI Decision-Making</title>

<guid>title:who does what archetypes of roles assigned to llms during human ai decision making</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 13:23:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>LLMs are increasingly supporting decision-making across high-stakes domains, requiring critical reflection on the socio-technical factors that shape how humans and LLMs are assigned roles and interact during human-in-the-loop decision-making. This paper introduces the concept of human-LLM archetypes -- defined as re-curring socio-technical interaction patterns that structure the roles of humans and LLMs in collaborative decision-making. We describe 17 human-LLM archetypes derived from a scoping literature review and thematic analysis of 113 LLM-supported decision-making papers. Then, we evaluate these diverse archetypes across real-world clinical diagnostic cases to examine the potential effects of adopting distinct human-LLM archetypes on LLM outputs and decision outcomes. Finally, we present relevant tradeoffs and design choices across human-LLM archetypes, including decision control, social hierarchies, cognitive forcing strategies, and information requirements. Through our analysis, we show that selection of human-LLM interaction archetype can influence LLM outputs and decisions, bringing important risks and considerations for the designers of human-AI decision-making systems</description>

<title>Evaluating Alignment of Behavioral Dispositions in LLMs</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11328</link>
<guid>title:evaluating alignment of behavioral dispositions in llms</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 19:59:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>As LLMs integrate into our daily lives, understanding their behavior becomes essential. In this work, we focus on behavioral dispositions$-$the underlying tendencies that shape responses in social contexts$-$and introduce a framework to study how closely the dispositions expressed by LLMs align with those of humans. Our approach is grounded in established psychological questionnaires but adapts them for LLMs by transforming human self-report statements into Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs). These SJTs assess behavior by eliciting natural recommendations in realistic user-assistant scenarios. We generate 2,500 SJTs, each validated by three human annotators, and collect preferred actions from 10 annotators per SJT, from a large pool of 550 participants. In a comprehensive study involving 25 LLMs, we find that models often do not reflect the distribution of human preferences: (1) in scenarios with low human consensus, LLMs consistently exhibit overconfidence in a single response; (2) when human consensus is high, smaller models deviate significantly, and even some frontier models do not reflect the consensus in 15-20% of cases; (3) traits can exhibit cross-LLM patterns, e.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 18:55:54 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual generation. Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\textbf{U}$ation $\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.</description>

<guid>title:eliminating vae for fast and high resolution generative detail restoration</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 08:23:30 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Diffusion models have attained remarkable breakthroughs in the real-world super-resolution (SR) task, albeit at slow inference and high demand on devices. To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns.</description>

<title>Sample-Efficient Real-World Dexterous Policy Fine-Tuning via Action-Chunked Critics and Normalizing Flows</title>

<guid>title:sample efficient real world dexterous policy fine tuning via action chunked critics and normalizing flows</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 09:28:20 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Real-world fine-tuning of dexterous manipulation policies remains challenging due to limited real-world interaction budgets and highly multimodal action distributions. Diffusion-based policies, while expressive, do not permit conservative likelihood-based updates during fine-tuning because action probabilities are intractable. In contrast, conventional Gaussian policies collapse under multimodality, particularly when actions are executed in chunks, and standard per-step critics fail to align with chunked execution, leading to poor credit assignment. We present SOFT-FLOW, a sample-efficient off-policy fine-tuning framework with normalizing flow (NF) to address these challenges. The normalizing flow policy yields exact likelihoods for multimodal action chunks, allowing conservative, stable policy updates through likelihood regularization and thereby improving sample efficiency. An action-chunked critic evaluates entire action sequences, aligning value estimation with the policy's temporal structure and improving long-horizon credit assignment.</description>

<guid>title:on the adoption of ai coding agents in open source android and ios development</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:30:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>AI coding agents are increasingly contributing to software development, yet their impact on mobile development has received little empirical attention. In this paper, we present the first category-level empirical study of agent-generated code in open-source mobile app projects. We analyzed PR acceptance behaviors across mobile platforms, agents, and task categories using 2,901 AI-authored pull requests (PRs) in 193 verified Android and iOS open-source GitHub repositories in the AIDev dataset. We find that Android projects have received 2x more AI-authored PRs and have achieved higher PR acceptance rate (71%) than iOS (63%), with significant agent-level variation on Android. Across task categories, PRs with routine tasks (feature, fix, and ui) achieve the highest acceptance, while structural changes like refactor and build achieve lower success and longer resolution times. Furthermore, our evolution analysis shows improvement in PR resolution time on Android through mid-2025 before it declined again.</description>

<guid>title:protecting context and prompts deterministic security for non deterministic ai</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 03:38:59 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large Language Model (LLM) applications are vulnerable to prompt injection and context manipulation attacks that traditional security models cannot prevent. We introduce two novel primitives--authenticated prompts and authenticated context--that provide cryptographically verifiable provenance across LLM workflows. Authenticated prompts enable self-contained lineage verification, while authenticated context uses tamper-evident hash chains to ensure integrity of dynamic inputs. Building on these primitives, we formalize a policy algebra with four proven theorems providing protocol-level Byzantine resistance--even adversarial agents cannot violate organizational policies. Five complementary defenses--from lightweight resource controls to LLM-based semantic validation--deliver layered, preventative security with formal guarantees. Evaluation against representative attacks spanning 6 exhaustive categories achieves 100% detection with zero false positives and nominal overhead.</description>

<title>STaR: Scalable Task-Conditioned Retrieval for Long-Horizon Multimodal Robot Memory</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.09255</link>
<guid>title:star scalable task conditioned retrieval for long horizon multimodal robot memory</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 22:38:53 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Mobile robots are often deployed over long durations in diverse open, dynamic scenes, including indoor setting such as warehouses and manufacturing facilities, and outdoor settings such as agricultural and roadway operations. A core challenge is to build a scalable long-horizon memory that supports an agentic workflow for planning, retrieval, and reasoning over open-ended instructions at variable granularity, while producing precise, actionable answers for navigation. We present STaR, an agentic reasoning framework that (i) constructs a task-agnostic, multimodal long-term memory that generalizes to unseen queries while preserving fine-grained environmental semantics (object attributes, spatial relations, and dynamic events), and (ii) introduces a Scalable Task Conditioned Retrieval algorithm based on the Information Bottleneck principle to extract from long-term memory a compact, non-redundant, information-rich set of candidate memories for contextual reasoning. We evaluate STaR on NaVQA (mixed indoor/outdoor campus scenes) and WH-VQA, a customized warehouse benchmark with many visually similar objects built with Isaac Sim, emphasizing contextual reasoning. Across the two datasets, STaR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher success rates and markedly lower spatial error. We further deploy STaR on a real Husky wheeled robot in both indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating robust long horizon reasoning, scalability, and practical utility.</description>

<description>Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video.</description>

<title>CoFEH: LLM-driven Feature Engineering Empowered by Collaborative Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization</title>

<description>Feature Engineering (FE) is pivotal in automated machine learning (AutoML) but remains a bottleneck for traditional methods, which treat it as a black-box search, operating within rigid, predefined search spaces and lacking domain awareness. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging semantic reasoning to generate unbounded operators, existing methods fail to construct free-form FE pipelines, remaining confined to isolated subtasks such as feature generation. Most importantly, they are rarely optimized jointly with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of the ML model, leading to greedy &quot;FE-then-HPO&quot; workflows that cannot capture strong FE-HPO interactions. In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML. CoFEH uses an LLM-driven FE optimizer powered by Tree of Thought (ToT) to explore flexible FE pipelines, a Bayesian optimization (BO) module to solve HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector that realizes interleaved optimization by adaptively scheduling FE and HPO steps. Crucially, we introduce a mutual conditioning mechanism that shares context between LLM and BO, enabling mutually informed decisions.</description>

<guid>title:grounding ltl tasks in sub symbolic rl environments for zero shot generalization</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:20:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In this work we address the problem of training a Reinforcement Learning agent to follow multiple temporally-extended instructions expressed in Linear Temporal Logic in sub-symbolic environments. Previous multi-task work has mostly relied on knowledge of the mapping between raw observations and symbols appearing in the formulae. We drop this unrealistic assumption by jointly training a multi-task policy and a symbol grounder with the same experience. The symbol grounder is trained only from raw observations and sparse rewards via Neural Reward Machines in a semi-supervised fashion. Experiments on vision-based environments show that our method achieves performance comparable to using the true symbol grounding and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for sub-symbolic environments.</description>

<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 18:37:23 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This paper presents a technical curriculum on language-oriented artificial intelligence (AI) in the language and translation (L&amp;amp;T) industry. The curriculum aims to foster domain-specific technical AI literacy among stakeholders in the fields of translation and specialised communication by exposing them to the conceptual and technical/algorithmic foundations of modern language-oriented AI in an accessible way. The core curriculum focuses on 1) vector embeddings, 2) the technical foundations of neural networks, 3) tokenization and 4) transformer neural networks. It is intended to help users develop computational thinking as well as algorithmic awareness and algorithmic agency, ultimately contributing to their digital resilience in AI-driven work environments. The didactic suitability of the curriculum was tested in an AI-focused MA course at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication at TH Koeln. Results suggest the didactic effectiveness of the curriculum, but participant feedback indicates that it should be embedded into higher-level didactic scaffolding - e.</description>

<title>Flow-Enabled Generalization to Human Demonstrations in Few-Shot Imitation Learning</title>

<guid>title:flow enabled generalization to human demonstrations in few shot imitation learning</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 07:32:27 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Imitation Learning (IL) enables robots to learn complex skills from demonstrations without explicit task modeling, but it typically requires large amounts of demonstrations, creating significant collection costs. Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP).</description>

<title>Breaking the Pre-Sampling Barrier: Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency</title>

<guid>title:breaking the pre sampling barrier activation informed difficulty aware self consistency</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 06:05:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Self-Consistency (SC) is an effective decoding strategy that improves the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating multiple chain-of-thought reasoning paths and selecting the final answer via majority voting. However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls.</description>

<description>Quantifying the impacts of air pollution on health and climate relies on key atmospheric particle properties such as toxicity and hygroscopicity. However, these properties typically require complex observational techniques or expensive particle-resolved numerical simulations, limiting the availability of labeled data. We therefore estimate these hard-to-measure particle properties from routinely available observations (e. g. , air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions). Because routine observations only indirectly reflect particle composition and structure, the mapping from routine observations to particle properties is noisy and input-dependent, yielding a heteroscedastic regression setting.</description>

<guid>title:adora training reasoning models with dynamic advantage estimation on reinforcement learning</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 17:40:39 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone technique for developing reasoning models in complex tasks, ranging from mathematical problem-solving to imaginary reasoning. The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{ADORA} (\textbf{A}dvantage \textbf{D}ynamics via \textbf{O}nline \textbf{R}ollout \textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts.</description>

<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 12:42:41 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Quality Estimation (QE) aims to assess the quality of machine translation (MT) outputs without relying on reference translations, making it essential for real-world, large-scale MT evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in advancing the field of quality estimation of machine translation. However, most of the QE approaches solely rely on scalar quality scores, offering no explicit information about the translation errors that should drive these judgments. Moreover, for low-resource languages where annotated QE data is limited, existing approaches struggle to achieve reliable performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the first segment-level QE dataset for English to Malayalam, a severely resource-scarce language pair in the QE domain, comprising human-annotated Direct Assessment (DA) scores and Translation Quality Remarks (TQR), which are short, contextual, free-form annotator comments that describe translation errors. We further introduce ALOPE-RL, a policy-based reinforcement learning framework that trains efficient adapters based on policy rewards derived from DA score and TQR.</description>

<title>The Neurosymbolic Frontier of Nonuniform Ellipticity: Formalizing Sharp Schauder Theory via Topos-Theoretic Reasoning Models</title>

<guid>title:the neurosymbolic frontier of nonuniform ellipticity formalizing sharp schauder theory via topos theoretic reasoning models</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 08:24:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This white paper presents a critical synthesis of the recent breakthrough in nonuniformly elliptic regularity theory and the burgeoning field of neurosymbolic large reasoning models (LRMs). We explore the resolution of the long-standing sharp growth rate conjecture in Schauder theory, achieved by Cristiana De Filippis and Giuseppe Mingione, which identifies the exact threshold $q/p &lt; 1 + α/n$ for gradient Hölder continuity. Central to this mathematical achievement is the ``ghost equation'' methodology, a sophisticated auxiliary derivation that bypasses the non-differentiability of classical Euler-Lagrange systems. We propose that the next era of mathematical discovery lies in the integration of these pure analytical constructs with LRMs grounded in topos theory and formal verification frameworks such as Safe and Typed Chain-of-Thought (PC-CoT). By modeling the reasoning process as a categorical colimit in a slice topos, we demonstrate how LRMs can autonomously navigate the ``Dark Side'' of the calculus of variations, providing machine-checkable proofs for regularity bounds in complex, multi-phase physical systems.</description>

<title>Near-Oracle KV Selection via Pre-hoc Sparsity for Long-Context Inference</title>

<guid>title:near oracle kv selection via pre hoc sparsity for long context inference</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 07:05:23 +0000</pubDate>
<description>A core bottleneck in large language model (LLM) inference is the cost of attending over the ever-growing key-value (KV) cache. Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i. e. , selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control.</description>

<guid>title:listen to the layers mitigating hallucinations with inter layer disagreement</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 07:32:37 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent yet factually incorrect text-a phenomenon known as hallucinations, undermining their reliability and utility in downstream tasks. We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.</description>

<title>New Skills or Sharper Primitives? A Probabilistic Perspective on the Emergence of Reasoning in RLVR</title>

<guid>title:new skills or sharper primitives a probabilistic perspective on the emergence of reasoning in rlvr</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:23:13 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Whether Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) endows Large Language Models (LLMs) with new capabilities or merely elicits latent traces remains a central debate. In this work, we align with the former view, proposing a probabilistic framework where capability is defined by instance-level solvability. We hypothesize that the emergence of complex reasoning can be driven by sharpening atomic step probabilities, which enables models to overcome the exponential decay of success rates inherent in multi-step reasoning chains. Utilizing the Algebrarium framework, we train models exclusively on single-step operations and evaluate their performance on unseen multi-step tasks. Our empirical results confirm that: (1) RLVR incentivizes the exploration of previously inaccessible solution paths by amplifying the model's existing skills; (2) composite performance is strictly governed by the joint probability of atomic steps, evidenced by high Pearson correlation coefficients ($ρ\in [0. 69, 0.</description>

<title>Triggered: A Statistical Analysis of Environmental Influences on Extremist Groups</title>

<guid>title:triggered a statistical analysis of environmental influences on extremist groups</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:15:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Online extremist communities operate within a wider information ecosystem shaped by real-world events, news coverage, and cross-community interaction. We adopt a systems perspective to examine these influences using seven years of data from two ideologically distinct extremist forums (Stormfront and Incels) and a mainstream reference community (r/News). We ask three questions: how extremist violence impacts community behaviour; whether news coverage of political entities predicts shifts in conversation dynamics; and whether linguistic diffusion occurs between mainstream and extremist spaces and across extremist ideologies. Methodologically, we combine counterfactual synthesis to estimate event-level impacts with vector autoregression and Granger causality analyses to model ongoing relationships among news signals, behavioural outcomes, and cross-community language change. Across analyses, our results indicate that Stormfront and r/News appear to be more reactive to external stimuli, while Incels demonstrates less cross-community linguistic influence and less responsiveness to news and violent events. These findings underscore that extremist communities are not homogeneous, but differ in how tightly they are coupled to the surrounding information ecosystem.</description>

<guid>title:train less infer faster efficient model finetuning and compression via structured sparsity</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 20:20:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Fully finetuning foundation language models (LMs) with billions of parameters is often impractical due to high computational costs, memory requirements, and the risk of overfitting. Although methods like low-rank adapters help address these challenges by adding small trainable modules to the frozen LM, they also increase memory usage and do not reduce inference latency. We uncover an intriguing phenomenon: sparsifying specific model rows and columns enables efficient task adaptation without requiring weight tuning. We propose a scheme for effective finetuning via sparsification using training stochastic gates, which requires minimal trainable parameters, reduces inference time, and removes 20--40\% of model parameters without significant accuracy loss. Empirical results show it outperforms recent finetuning baselines in efficiency and performance. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of this stochastic gating process, and show that our method admits a simpler and better-conditioned optimization landscape compared to LoRA.</description>

<pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 20:12:38 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Scientific knowledge bases accelerate discovery by curating findings from primary literature into structured, queryable formats for both human researchers and emerging AI systems. Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:10:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely collected and shared for research under strict regulatory frameworks. These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods. Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation.</description>

<guid>title:mcie multimodal llm driven complex instruction image editing with spatial guidance</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 14:40:54 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Recent advances in instruction-based image editing have shown remarkable progress. However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions. In this work, we address these limitations from the perspectives of architectural design, data, and evaluation protocols. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency.</description>

<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 07:33:09 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Let’s be honest — Large Language Models (LLMs) are incredibly smart… until they aren’t. To know the fundamentals of transformers architecture, read my deep dive blog on it from here . They can explain quantum physics or write code, but sometimes they confidently make things up. Not because they want to lie, but because they’re trained to predict language, not verify facts. If you’ve read my previous post on hallucinations, you know how easily an AI can sound correct while being completely wrong. And that’s exactly where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enters the story.</description>

<description>How to Train a Language Model on Your Resume (and Why You Shouldn’t) Super cool AI generated image of a resume transforming into an LLM Introduction It’s no mystery that the STEM job market is a bit hectic right now. But, it still makes us question whether the struggle is the market or is it us? Maybe I’m not conveying my strengths well enough to employers? What could be a solution to this? One solution I had was to add a Small Language Model (SLM) chatbot to my personal website (don’t judge it. Even now, it’s probably not done).</description>

<description>TL;DR: If your LLM app “mostly works” in production, you might already be paying hidden costs in latency, cloud bills, and user trust. Before tuning your prompt one more time, run this 30-minute audit. This is a developer-focused companion to the original article on whether you need an LLM audit. If you want broader context on how GenAI-specific audit differs from general AI system audit , check out this companion piece: https://optyxstack. com/llm-audit/genai-audit-vs-ai-system-audit The Real Problem: “Mostly Works” in Production In early demos, everything looks fine. In production, you start hearing: “Sometimes it makes things up.</description>

<description>This is a submission for the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge What I Built What if GitHub Copilot could teach you to code, not just code for you? Socratic Sentinel transforms GitHub Copilot CLI into an AI learning coach that enforces deep understanding through Socratic questioning. Instead of handing you solutions, it guides you there — combating the &quot;competence collapse&quot; developers are discussing across Reddit, Hacker News, and X in 2026. It’s a custom Copilot agent built with official Agent Client Protocol (ACP) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) that intercepts queries in real-time and responds with targeted questions (e. g. , &quot;What's the key invariant in binary search?</description>

<description>Most Laravel developers hit the same wall when integrating Claude: the official docs focus on JavaScript, most community guides assume Python, and Laravel tutorials stop at toy chatbots that break under real load. This guide shows how Claude fits into a production Laravel 11 codebase—how to structure the integration cleanly and why certain decisions matter once AI becomes a dependency instead of an experiment. We’ll build in layers. Each part expands the system, explains why a pattern exists, and walks through the code. By the end, you’ll understand not just how to call Claude, but how to reason about AI integration the same way you reason about databases, queues, and external services. Stack: Laravel 11, Claude Messages API, raw HTTP (no SDK).</description>

<description>Your AI chatbot's &quot;memory&quot; isn't magic—it's your database architecture. And choosing wrong costs enterprises millions in latency, scaling failures, and missed retrieval accuracy. Ever wonder how your AI chatbot seems to &quot;remember&quot; facts or search your documents? It's not magic - it's the database. Today's AI-powered apps (from customer support bots to coding assistants) need to fetch information by meaning , not just exact matches. This has sparked a seismic shift in the database world.</description>

<title>Project Vend: Phase two</title>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 08:45:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<description>Published on February 12, 2026 7:38 PM GMT 1. Summary and overview LLMs seem to lack metacognitive skills that help humans catch errors. Improvements to those skills might be net positive for alignment, despite improving capabilities in new directions. Better metacognition would reduce LLM errors by catching mistakes, and by managing complex cognition to produce better answers in the first place. This could stabilize or regularize alignment, allowing systems to avoid actions they would not &quot;endorse on reflection&quot; (in some functional sense). [1] Better metacognition could also make LLM systems useful for clarifying the conceptual problems of alignment.</description>

<title>How do we (more) safely defer to AIs?</title>

<description>Published on February 12, 2026 4:55 PM GMT As AI systems get more capable, it becomes increasingly uncompetitive and infeasible to avoid deferring to AIs on increasingly many decisions. Further, once systems are sufficiently capable, control becomes infeasible . [1] Thus, one of the main strategies for handling AI risk is fully (or almost fully) deferring to AIs on managing these risks. Broadly speaking, when I say &quot;deferring to AIs&quot; [2] I mean having these AIs do virtually all of the work to develop more capable and aligned successor AIs, managing exogenous risks, and making strategic decisions. [3] If we plan to defer to AIs, I think it's safest to do so only a bit above the minimum level of qualitative capability/intelligence required to automate safety research, implementation, and strategy. [4] For deference to go well, we both need it to be the case that the AIs we defer to aren't scheming against us and that they are sufficiently aligned and effective on key tasks (aligning the next generation of AIs, buying more time to work on alignment, making good strategic decisions).</description>

<title>How Generative and Agentic AI Shift Concern from Technical Debt to Cognitive Debt</title>

<guid>title:how generative and agentic ai shift concern from technical debt to cognitive debt</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 05:20:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>How Generative and Agentic AI Shift Concern from Technical Debt to Cognitive Debt This piece by Margaret-Anne Storey is the best explanation of the term cognitive debt I've seen so far. Cognitive debt , a term gaining traction recently, instead communicates the notion that the debt compounded from going fast lives in the brains of the developers and affects their lived experiences and abilities to “go fast” or to make changes. Even if AI agents produce code that could be easy to understand, the humans involved may have simply lost the plot and may not understand what the program is supposed to do, how their intentions were implemented, or how to possibly change it. Margaret-Anne expands on this further with an anecdote about a student team she coached: But by weeks 7 or 8, one team hit a wall. They could no longer make even simple changes without breaking something unexpected. When I met with them, the team initially blamed technical debt: messy code, poor architecture, hurried implementations.</description>

<description>A guide to enhancing vector-based Search and Recommendations using Multimodal AI and Filtered KNN Image by the author — Generated with ChatGPT. I recently published a story describing how to build an image-based recommendation system and search engine using the ResNet model as an embedding model, and Elasticsearch as a vector database . While the recommendation system performs well overall, we found that some recommended items do not belong to the same category as the query item. To address this, we used Elasticsearch’s filtered KNN to improve recommendation relevance. We observed a similar issue in the search engine results, as illustrated in the image below. The goal of this story is to address this limitation by first applying a classification model to identify the query image's category and then using that category to perform a filtered KNN search in Elasticsearch.</description>

<title>From LLMs to Agents: Generalizability from the Inside Out</title>

<guid>title:from llms to agents generalizability from the inside out</guid>
<pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:41:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Achieving a powerful synergy in human-AI collaboration requires extreme versatility in agent capabilities, both at the level of generalization across modalities, languages, tasks, and domains in its own reasoning and problem solving, as well as in its role-taking and interactive strategy enactment in collaboration. This talk first explores model generalization from the inside out, building on insights into the complementary affordances of disparate data sources as they are transformed through a learning process, and then turning outwards to application across five tasks, including event ordering, question answering, form understanding, multi-lingual relation extraction, and reasoning path prediction. The concept of learning from contrasting cases is demonstrated to facilitate easy-to-hard generalization by fostering more nuanced instruction following skills. The concept of scaffolding is also used to illustrate how representations of reasoning may extend model capabilities beyond a natural frontier, either through augmentations injected into the learning process or as part of inference-time interaction with a human or agent partner or with the environment. Extending 3 decades of research into AI-supported collaborative work, the talk ends with a discussion about work-in-progress extending model generalization research into an agentic setting where intelligent collaborative agents participate in collaboration with another agent, a human collaborator, or a group of humans.

<title>Signs of introspection in large language models</title>

<guid>title:signs of introspection in large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 08:46:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Have you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so? Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability.</description>

<description>The Economic Research team studies how AI is reshaping the economy, including work, productivity, and economic opportunity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, we track AI's real-world economic effects and publish research that helps policymakers, businesses, and the public understand and prepare for the changes ahead. We build the empirical foundation for understanding AI's economic impact. Our flagship Anthropic Economic Index tracks how AI tools are actually being used around the world and across every sector of the economy—moving beyond speculation to measure adoption patterns as they unfold. Alongside our index reports, we produce novel research that studies the implications of AI usage and diffusion—as tracked in the index—for workers, for firms, and for the broader economy. Economic transitions create both opportunity and disruption.</description>

<description>Future AI systems will be even more powerful than today’s, likely in ways that break key assumptions behind current safety techniques. That’s why it’s important to develop sophisticated safeguards to ensure models remain helpful, honest, and harmless. The Alignment team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely. Alignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own. Alignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.</description>
