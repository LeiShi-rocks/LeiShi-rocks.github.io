<title>RISE-Video: Can Video Generators Decode Implicit World Rules?</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.05986</link>
<guid>title:rise video can video generators decode implicit world rules</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:36:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>While generative video models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, their capacity to internalize and reason over implicit world rules remains a critical yet under-explored frontier. To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains. Our framework introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol consisting of four metrics: \textit{Reasoning Alignment}, \textit{Temporal Consistency}, \textit{Physical Rationality}, and \textit{Visual Quality}. To further support scalable evaluation, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to emulate human-centric assessment. Extensive experiments on 11 state-of-the-art TI2V models reveal pervasive deficiencies in simulating complex scenarios under implicit constraints, offering critical insights for the advancement of future world-simulating generative models.</description>

<title>Sparse Video Generation Propels Real-World Beyond-the-View Vision-Language Navigation</title>

<guid>title:sparse video generation propels real world beyond the view vision language navigation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:16:13 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training.</description>

<title>Better Source, Better Flow: Learning Condition-Dependent Source Distribution for Flow Matching</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.05951</link>
<guid>title:better source better flow learning condition dependent source distribution for flow matching</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:08:20 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, particularly for text-to-image generation. Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective.</description>

<title>DLM-Scope: Mechanistic Interpretability of Diffusion Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders</title>

<guid>title:dlm scope mechanistic interpretability of diffusion language models via sparse autoencoders</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:41:25 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs.</description>

<title>CASTLE: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Student-Tailored Personalized Safety in Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.05633</link>
<guid>title:castle a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating student tailored personalized safety in large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:13:19 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of personalized learning in education. However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios.</description>

<title>CellForge: Agentic Design of Virtual Cell Models</title>

<guid>arxiv:2508.02276</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2508. 02276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Virtual cell modeling aims to predict cellular responses to diverse perturbations but faces challenges from biological complexity, multimodal data heterogeneity, and the need for interdisciplinary expertise. We introduce CellForge, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and synthesizes neural network architectures tailored to specific single-cell datasets and perturbation tasks. Given raw multi-omics data and task descriptions, CellForge discovers candidate architectures through collaborative reasoning among specialized agents, then generates executable implementations. Our core contribution is the framework itself: showing that multi-agent collaboration mechanisms - rather than manual human design or single-LLM prompting - can autonomously produce executable, high-quality computational methods. This approach goes beyond conventional hyperparameter tuning by enabling entirely new architectural components such as trajectory-aware encoders and perturbation diffusion modules to emerge from agentic deliberation.</description>

<title>Learning Where It Matters: Geometric Anchoring for Robust Preference Alignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04909</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.04909</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 04909v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and related methods align large language models from pairwise preferences by regularizing updates against a fixed reference policy. As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity.</description>

<title>XEmoGPT: An Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition Framework with Cue-Level Perception and Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05496</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.05496</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 05496v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition plays a crucial role in applications such as human-computer interaction and social media analytics. However, current approaches struggle with cue-level perception and reasoning due to two main challenges: 1) general-purpose modality encoders are pretrained to capture global structures and general semantics rather than fine-grained emotional cues, resulting in limited sensitivity to emotional signals; and 2) available datasets usually involve a trade-off between annotation quality and scale, which leads to insufficient supervision for emotional cues and ultimately limits cue-level reasoning. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics are inadequate for assessing cue-level reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose eXplainable Emotion GPT (XEmoGPT), a novel EMER framework capable of both perceiving and reasoning over emotional cues. It incorporates two specialized modules: the Video Emotional Cue Bridge (VECB) and the Audio Emotional Cue Bridge (AECB), which enhance the video and audio encoders through carefully designed tasks for fine-grained emotional cue perception.</description>

<title>Consistency-Preserving Concept Erasure via Unsafe-Safe Pairing and Directional Fisher-weighted Adaptation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05339</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.05339</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 05339v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: With the increasing versatility of text-to-image diffusion models, the ability to selectively erase undesirable concepts (e. g. , harmful content) has become indispensable. However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs.</description>

<pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 05480v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery provide complementary strengths that constitute the critical foundation for transcending single-modality constraints and facilitating cross-modal collaborative processing and intelligent interpretation. However, existing benchmark datasets often suffer from limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for supporting the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1. 3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.</description>

<title>Guided Diffusion Sampling on Function Spaces with Applications to PDEs</title>

<pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2505. 17004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We propose a general framework for conditional sampling in PDE-based inverse problems, targeting the recovery of whole solutions from extremely sparse or noisy measurements. This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an unconditional, discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional Banach spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling approach.</description>

<title>Conditional Diffusion Guidance under Hard Constraint: A Stochastic Analysis Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05533</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.05533</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 05533v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model.</description>

<description>An Update on Heroku An ominous headline to see on the official Heroku blog and yes, it's bad news. Today, Heroku is transitioning to a sustaining engineering model focused on stability, security, reliability, and support. Heroku remains an actively supported, production-ready platform, with an emphasis on maintaining quality and operational excellence rather than introducing new features. We know changes like this can raise questions, and we want to be clear about what this means for customers. Based on context I'm guessing a &quot;sustaining engineering model&quot; (this definitely isn't a widely used industry term) means that they'll keep the lights on and that's it. This is a very frustrating piece of corporate communication.</description>

<title>Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04986</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.04986</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 04986v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: &quot;familiar intelligence&quot; and &quot;strange intelligence&quot;. AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which &quot;general intelligence&quot; is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks.</description>

<title>Imposing Boundary Conditions on Neural Operators via Learned Function Extensions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04923</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.04923</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 04923v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their ability to handle general, highly variable boundary conditions (BCs) remains limited. Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time.</description>
