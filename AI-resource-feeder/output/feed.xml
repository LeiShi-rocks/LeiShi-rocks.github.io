<guid>title:anthropic acquires vercept to advance claude s computer use capabilities</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:34 +0000</pubDate>
<description>People are using Claude for increasingly complex work—writing and running code across entire repositories, synthesizing research from dozens of sources, and managing workflows that span multiple tools and teams. Computer use enables Claude to do all of that inside live applications, the way a person at a keyboard would. That means Claude can take on multi-step tasks in live applications, and solve problems impossible with code alone. Today, we're announcing that Anthropic has acquired Vercept to help us push those capabilities further. Vercept was built around a clear thesis: making AI genuinely useful for completing complex tasks requires solving hard perception and interaction problems. The Vercept team—including co-founders Kiana Ehsani, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick—have spent years thinking carefully about how AI systems can see and act within the same software humans use every day.</description>

<description>Earlier today, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth shared on X that he is directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a supply chain risk. This action follows months of negotiations that reached an impasse over two exceptions we requested to the lawful use of our AI model, Claude: the mass domestic surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons. We have not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations. We have tried in good faith to reach an agreement with the Department of War, making clear that we support all lawful uses of AI for national security aside from the two narrow exceptions above. To the best of our knowledge, these exceptions have not affected a single government mission to date.</description>

<guid>title:detecting and preventing distillation attacks</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:41 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We have identified industrial-scale campaigns by three AI laboratories—DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax—to illicitly extract Claude’s capabilities to improve their own models. These labs generated over 16 million exchanges with Claude through approximately 24,000 fraudulent accounts, in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions. These labs used a technique called “distillation,” which involves training a less capable model on the outputs of a stronger one. Distillation is a widely used and legitimate training method. For example, frontier AI labs routinely distill their own models to create smaller, cheaper versions for their customers. But distillation can also be used for illicit purposes: competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently.</description>

<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:38 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We’re releasing the third version of our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), the voluntary framework we use to mitigate catastrophic risks from AI systems. Anthropic has now had an RSP for more than two years, and we’ve learned a great deal about its benefits and its shortcomings. We’re therefore updating the policy to reinforce what has worked well to date, improve the policy where necessary, and implement new measures to increase the transparency and accountability of our decision-making. You can read the new RSP in full here . In this post, we’ll discuss some of the thinking behind the changes.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<description>I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community. We were the first frontier AI company to deploy our models in the US government’s classified networks, the first to deploy them at the National Laboratories , and the first to provide custom models for national security customers. Claude is extensively deployed across the Department of War and other national security agencies for mission-critical applications, such as intelligence analysis, modeling and simulation, operational planning, cyber operations, and more. Anthropic has also acted to defend America’s lead in AI, even when it is against the company’s short-term interest. We chose to forgo several hundred million dollars in revenue to cut off the use of Claude by firms linked to the Chinese Communist Party (some of whom have been designated by the Department of War as Chinese Military Companies), shut down CCP-sponsored cyberattacks that attempted to abuse Claude, and have advocated for strong export controls on chips to ensure a democratic advantage.</description>

<guid>title:panoenv exploring 3d spatial intelligence in panoramic environments with reinforcement learning</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 15:12:17 +0000</pubDate>
<description>360 panoramic images are increasingly used in virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics for holistic scene understanding. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14. 8K questions across five categories (e. g. , relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes.</description>

<title>SoPE: Spherical Coordinate-Based Positional Embedding for Enhancing Spatial Perception of 3D LVLMs</title>

<guid>title:sope spherical coordinate based positional embedding for enhancing spatial perception of 3d lvlms</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 07:42:15 +0000</pubDate>
<description>3D Large Vision-Language Models (3D LVLMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various multimodal tasks. However, their inherited position-dependent modeling mechanism, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), remains suboptimal for 3D multimodal understanding. The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning.</description>

<title>No Caption, No Problem: Caption-Free Membership Inference via Model-Fitted Embeddings</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22689</link>
<guid>title:no caption no problem caption free membership inference via model fitted embeddings</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 07:07:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity text-to-image generation, but their tendency to memorize training data raises critical privacy and intellectual property concerns. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled way to audit such memorization by determining whether a given sample was included in training. However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image.</description>

<title>UCM: Unifying Camera Control and Memory with Time-aware Positional Encoding Warping for World Models</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22960</link>
<guid>title:ucm unifying camera control and memory with time aware positional encoding warping for world models</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 12:54:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>World models based on video generation demonstrate remarkable potential for simulating interactive environments but face persistent difficulties in two key areas: maintaining long-term content consistency when scenes are revisited and enabling precise camera control from user-provided inputs. Existing methods based on explicit 3D reconstruction often compromise flexibility in unbounded scenarios and fine-grained structures. Alternative methods rely directly on previously generated frames without establishing explicit spatial correspondence, thereby constraining controllability and consistency. To address these limitations, we present UCM, a novel framework that unifies long-term memory and precise camera control via a time-aware positional encoding warping mechanism. To reduce computational overhead, we design an efficient dual-stream diffusion transformer for high-fidelity generation. Moreover, we introduce a scalable data curation strategy utilizing point-cloud-based rendering to simulate scene revisiting, facilitating training on over 500K monocular videos.</description>

<title>Towards Better RL Training Data Utilization via Second-Order Rollout</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22765</link>
<guid>title:towards better rl training data utilization via second order rollout</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 08:55:58 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities, but vanilla RL mainly focuses on generation capability improvement by training with only first-order rollout (generating multiple responses for a question), and we argue that this approach fails to fully exploit the potential of training data because of the neglect of critique capability training. To tackle this problem, we further introduce the concept of second-order rollout (generating multiple critiques for a response) and propose a unified framework for jointly training generation and critique capabilities. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate that our approach can utilize training data more effectively than vanilla RL and achieve better performance under the same training data. Additionally, we uncover several insightful findings regarding second-order rollout and critique training, such as the importance of label balance in critique training and the noise problem of outcome-based rewards, which can be mitigated through sampling techniques. Our work offers a preliminary exploration of dynamic data augmentation and joint generation-critique training in RL, providing meaningful inspiration for the further advancement of RL training</description>

<title>SIGMA: A Semantic-Grounded Instruction-Driven Generative Multi-Task Recommender at AliExpress</title>

<guid>title:sigma a semantic grounded instruction driven generative multi task recommender at aliexpress</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 12:00:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models, generative recommendation is gradually reshaping the paradigm of recommender systems. However, most existing methods are still confined to the interaction-driven next-item prediction paradigm, failing to rapidly adapt to evolving trends or address diverse recommendation tasks along with business-specific requirements in real-world scenarios. To this end, we present SIGMA, a Semantic-Grounded Instruction-Driven Generative Multi-Task Recommender at AliExpress. Specifically, we first ground item entities in general semantics via a unified latent space capturing both semantic and collaborative relations. Building upon this, we develop a hybrid item tokenization method for precise modeling and efficient generation. Moreover, we construct a large-scale multi-task SFT dataset to empower SIGMA to fulfill various recommendation demands via instruction-following.</description>

<title>Interleaved Head Attention</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.21371</link>
<guid>title:interleaved head attention</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 21:05:23 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is the core computational primitive underlying modern Large Language Models (LLMs). However, MHA suffers from a fundamental linear scaling limitation: $H$ attention heads produce exactly $H$ independent attention matrices, with no communication between heads during attention computation. This becomes problematic for multi-step reasoning, where correct answers depend on aggregating evidence from multiple parts of the context and composing latent token-to-token relations over a chain of intermediate inferences. To address this, we propose Interleaved Head Attention (IHA), which enables cross-head mixing by constructing $P$ pseudo-heads per head (typically $P=H$), where each pseudo query/key/value is a learned linear combination of all $H$ original queries, keys and values respectively. Interactions between pseudo-query and pseudo-key heads induce up to $P^2$ attention patterns per head with modest parameter overhead $\mathcal{O}(H^2P)$. We provide theory showing improved efficiency in terms of number of parameters on the synthetic Polynomial task (IHA uses $Θ(\sqrt{k}n^2)$ parameters vs.</description>

<guid>title:beyond detection multi scale hidden code for natural image deepfake recovery and factual retrieval</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 08:47:48 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Recent advances in image authenticity have primarily focused on deepfake detection and localization, leaving recovery of tampered contents for factual retrieval relatively underexplored. We propose a unified hidden-code recovery framework that enables both retrieval and restoration from post-hoc and in-generation watermarking paradigms. Our method encodes semantic and perceptual information into a compact hidden-code representation, refined through multi-scale vector quantization, and enhances contextual reasoning via conditional Transformer modules. To enable systematic evaluation for natural images, we construct ImageNet-S, a benchmark that provides paired image-label factual retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-S demonstrate that our method exhibits promising retrieval and reconstruction performance while remaining fully compatible with diverse watermarking pipelines. This framework establishes a foundation for general-purpose image recovery beyond detection and localization.</description>

<title>Generalisation of RLHF under Reward Shift and Clipped KL Regularisation</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.21765</link>
<guid>title:generalisation of rlhf under reward shift and clipped kl regularisation</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 10:36:17 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Alignment and adaptation in large language models heavily rely on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); yet, theoretical understanding of its generalisability remains premature, especially when the learned reward could shift, and the KL control is estimated and clipped. To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 13:11:38 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Agentic systems increasingly rely on reusable procedural capabilities, \textit{a. k. a. , agentic skills}, to execute long-horizon workflows reliably. These capabilities are callable modules that package procedural knowledge with explicit applicability conditions, execution policies, termination criteria, and reusable interfaces. Unlike one-off plans or atomic tool calls, skills operate (and often do well) across tasks.</description>

<description>Sarcasm detection in multilingual and code-mixed environments remains a challenging task for natural language processing models due to structural variations, informal expressions, and low-resource linguistic availability. This study compares four large language models, Llama 3.1, Mistral, Gemma 3, and Phi-4, with a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for sarcasm detection in code-mixed Hinglish text. The results indicate that the smaller, sequentially fine-tuned DistilBERT model achieved the highest overall accuracy of 84%, outperforming all of the LLMs in zero and few-shot set ups, using minimal LLM generated code-mixed data used for fine-tuning. These findings indicate that domain-adaptive fine-tuning of smaller transformer based models may significantly improve sarcasm detection over general LLM inference, in low-resource and data scarce settings.</description>

<title>Adaptation to Intrinsic Dependence in Diffusion Language Models</title>

<guid>title:adaptation to intrinsic dependence in diffusion language models</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 18:41:34 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) approaches, enabling parallel token generation beyond a rigid left-to-right order. Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how unmasking schedules -- which specify the order and size of unmasked tokens during sampling -- affect generation quality remains limited. In this work, we introduce a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for DLMs that adapts to the (unknown) dependence structure of the target data distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to prior deterministic procedures that fix unmasking sizes, our method randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration. We show that, for two specific parameter choices, the sampling convergence guarantees -- measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence -- scale as $\widetilde O(\mathsf{TC}/K)$ and $\widetilde O(\mathsf{DTC}/K)$ respectively. Here, $K$ is the number of iterations, and $\mathsf{TC}$ and $\mathsf{DTC}$ are the total correlation and dual total correlation of the target distribution, capturing the intrinsic dependence structure underlying the data.</description>

<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 18:34:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for training reasoning language models (RLMs) by leveraging supervision from verifiers. Although verifier implementation is easier than solution annotation for many tasks, existing synthetic data generation methods remain largely solution-centric, while verifier-based methods rely on a few hand-crafted procedural environments. In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark. Ablations show that verifier-based supervision and increased task diversity both contribute significantly, providing empirical evidence that generating reasoning environments at scale can enhance reasoning abilities in RLMs</description>

<guid>title:muse harnessing precise and diverse semantics for few shot whole slide image classification</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 13:17:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In computational pathology, few-shot whole slide image classification is primarily driven by the extreme scarcity of expert-labeled slides. Recent vision-language methods incorporate textual semantics generated by large language models, but treat these descriptions as static class-level priors that are shared across all samples and lack sample-wise refinement. This limits both the diversity and precision of visual-semantic alignment, hindering generalization under limited supervision. To overcome this, we propose the stochastic MUlti-view Semantic Enhancement (MUSE), a framework that first refines semantic precision via sample-wise adaptation and then enhances semantic richness through retrieval-augmented multi-view generation. Specifically, MUSE introduces Sample-wise Fine-grained Semantic Enhancement (SFSE), which yields a fine-grained semantic prior for each sample through MoE-based adaptive visual-semantic interaction. Guided by this prior, Stochastic Multi-view Model Optimization (SMMO) constructs an LLM-generated knowledge base of diverse pathological descriptions per class, then retrieves and stochastically integrates multiple matched textual views during training.</description>

<title>Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation in Robotic Imitation</title>

<guid>title:primary fine decoupling for action generation in robotic imitation</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 08:36:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multi-modal distribution in robotic manipulation action sequences poses critical challenges for imitation learning. To this end, existing approaches often model the action space as either a discrete set of tokens or a continuous, latent-variable distribution. However, both approaches present trade-offs: some methods discretize actions into tokens and therefore lose fine-grained action variations, while others generate continuous actions in a single stage tend to produce unstable mode transitions. To address these limitations, we propose Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation (PF-DAG), a two-stage framework that decouples coarse action consistency from fine-grained variations. First, we compress action chunks into a small set of discrete modes, enabling a lightweight policy to select consistent coarse modes and avoid mode bouncing. Second, a mode conditioned MeanFlow policy is learned to generate high-fidelity continuous actions.</description>

<title>SibylSense: Adaptive Rubric Learning via Memory Tuning and Adversarial Probing</title>

<guid>title:sibylsense adaptive rubric learning via memory tuning and adversarial probing</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 10:28:44 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Designing aligned and robust rewards for open-ended generation remains a key barrier to RL post-training. Rubrics provide structured, interpretable supervision, but scaling rubric construction is difficult: expert rubrics are costly, prompted rubrics are often superficial or inconsistent, and fixed-pool discriminative rubrics can saturate and drift, enabling reward hacking. We present SibylSense, an inference-time learning approach that adapts a frozen rubric generator through a tunable memory bank of validated rubric items. Memory is updated via verifier-based item rewards measured by reference-candidate answer discriminative gaps from a handful of examples. SibylSense alternates memory tuning with a rubric-adversarial policy update that produces rubric-satisfying candidate answers, shrinking discriminative gaps and driving the rubric generator to capture new quality dimensions. Experiments on two open-ended tasks show that SibylSense yields more discriminative rubrics and improves downstream RL performance over static and non-adaptive baselines.</description>

<guid>title:duel evolve reward free test time scaling via llm self preferences</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:16:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Many applications seek to optimize LLM outputs at test time by iteratively proposing, scoring, and refining candidates over a discrete output space. Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates.</description>

<guid>title:specmind cognitively inspired interactive multi turn framework for postcondition inference</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 07:01:17 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Specifications are vital for ensuring program correctness, yet writing them manually remains challenging and time-intensive. Recent large language model (LLM)-based methods have shown successes in generating specifications such as postconditions, but existing single-pass prompting often yields inaccurate results. In this paper, we present SpecMind, a novel framework for postcondition generation that treats LLMs as interactive and exploratory reasoners rather than one-shot generators. SpecMind employs feedback-driven multi-turn prompting approaches, enabling the model to iteratively refine candidate postconditions by incorporating implicit and explicit correctness feedback, while autonomously deciding when to stop. This process fosters deeper code comprehension and improves alignment with true program behavior via exploratory attempts. Our empirical evaluation shows that SpecMind significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and completeness of generated postconditions.</description>

<title>Generalizing Visual Geometry Priors to Sparse Gaussian Occupancy Prediction</title>

<guid>title:generalizing visual geometry priors to sparse gaussian occupancy prediction</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 04:16:54 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Accurate 3D scene understanding is essential for embodied intelligence, with occupancy prediction emerging as a key task for reasoning about both objects and free space. Existing approaches largely rely on depth priors (e. g. , DepthAnything) but make only limited use of 3D cues, restricting performance and generalization. Recently, visual geometry models such as VGGT have shown strong capability in providing rich 3D priors, but similar to monocular depth foundation models, they still operate at the level of visible surfaces rather than volumetric interiors, motivating us to explore how to more effectively leverage these increasingly powerful geometry priors for 3D occupancy prediction. We present GPOcc, a framework that leverages generalizable visual geometry priors (GPs) for monocular occupancy prediction.</description>

<title>Decoupling Vision and Language: Codebook Anchored Visual Adaptation</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.19449</link>
<guid>title:decoupling vision and language codebook anchored visual adaptation</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 02:39:26 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) use their vision encoders to translate images into representations for downstream reasoning, but the encoders often underperform in domain-specific visual tasks such as medical image diagnosis or fine-grained classification, where representation errors can cascade through the language model, leading to incorrect responses. Existing adaptation methods modify the continuous feature interface between encoder and language model through projector tuning or other parameter-efficient updates, which still couples the two components and requires re-alignment whenever the encoder changes. We introduce CRAFT (Codebook RegulAted Fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that fine-tunes the encoder using a discrete codebook that anchors visual representations to a stable token space, achieving domain adaptation without modifying other parts of the model. This decoupled design allows the adapted encoder to seamlessly boost the performance of LVLMs with different language architectures, as long as they share the same codebook. Empirically, CRAFT achieves an average gain of 13.51% across 10 domain-specific benchmarks such as VQARAD and PlantVillage, while preserving the LLM's linguistic capabilities and outperforming peer methods that operate on continuous tokens.</description>

<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 11:33:21 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Implementations of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix-based neural networks for neural decoding remain fragmented across research codebases and Python packages. Existing implementations often employ ad hoc handling of manifold constraints and non-unified training setups, which hinders reproducibility and integration into modern deep-learning workflows. To address this gap, we introduce SPD Learn, a unified and modular Python package for geometric deep learning with SPD matrices. SPD Learn provides core SPD operators and neural-network layers, including numerically stable spectral operators, and enforces Stiefel/SPD constraints via trivialization-based parameterizations. This design enables standard backpropagation and optimization in unconstrained Euclidean spaces while producing manifold-constrained parameters by construction. The package also offers reference implementations of representative SPDNet-based models and interfaces with widely used brain computer interface/neuroimaging toolkits and modern machine-learning libraries (e.</description>

<description>Current AI weather forecasting models predict conventional atmospheric variables but cannot distinguish between cloud microphysical species critical for aviation safety. We introduce AviaSafe, a hierarchical, physics-informed neural forecaster that produces global, six-hourly predictions of these four hydrometeor species for lead times up to 7 days. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of cloud prediction: extreme sparsity, discontinuous distributions, and complex microphysical interactions between species. We integrate the Icing Condition (IC) index from aviation meteorology as a physics-based constraint that identifies regions where supercooled water fuels explosive ice crystal growth. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that first predicts cloud spatial distribution through masked attention, then quantifies species concentrations within identified regions. Training on ERA5 reanalysis data, our model achieves lower RMSE for cloud species compared to baseline and outperforms operational numerical models on certain key variables at 7-day lead times.</description>

<title>MedTri: A Platform for Structured Medical Report Normalization to Enhance Vision-Language Pretraining</title>

<guid>title:medtri a platform for structured medical report normalization to enhance vision language pretraining</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 17:49:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Medical vision-language pretraining increasingly relies on medical reports as large-scale supervisory signals; however, raw reports often exhibit substantial stylistic heterogeneity, variable length, and a considerable amount of image-irrelevant content. Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:51:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Despite rapid recent progress in the terminal capabilities of large language models, the training data strategies behind state-of-the-art terminal agents remain largely undisclosed. We address this gap through a systematic study of data engineering practices for terminal agents, making two key contributions: (1) Terminal-Task-Gen, a lightweight synthetic task generation pipeline that supports seed-based and skill-based task construction, and (2) a comprehensive analysis of data and training strategies, including filtering, curriculum learning, long context training, and scaling behavior. Our pipeline yields Terminal-Corpus, a large-scale open-source dataset for terminal tasks. Using this dataset, we train Nemotron-Terminal, a family of models initialized from Qwen3(8B, 14B, 32B) that achieve substantial gains on Terminal-Bench 2. 0: Nemotron-Terminal-8B improves from 2. 5% to 13.</description>

<guid>title:unlocking multimodal document intelligence from current triumphs to future frontiers of visual document retrieval</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 15:27:41 +0000</pubDate>
<description>With the rapid proliferation of multimodal information, Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) has emerged as a critical frontier in bridging the gap between unstructured visually rich data and precise information acquisition. Unlike traditional natural image retrieval, visual documents exhibit unique characteristics defined by dense textual content, intricate layouts, and fine-grained semantic dependencies. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of the VDR landscape, specifically through the lens of the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) era. We begin by examining the benchmark landscape, and subsequently dive into the methodological evolution, categorizing approaches into three primary aspects: multimodal embedding models, multimodal reranker models, and the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic systems for complex document intelligence. Finally, we identify persistent challenges and outline promising future directions, aiming to provide a clear roadmap for future multimodal document intelligence.</description>

<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 04:26:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We propose CoLyricist, an AI-assisted lyric writing tool designed to support the typical workflows of experienced lyricists and enhance their creative efficiency. While lyricists have unique processes, many follow common stages. Tools that fail to accommodate these stages challenge integration into creative practices. Existing research and tools lack sufficient understanding of these songwriting stages and their associated challenges, resulting in ineffective designs. Through a formative study involving semi-structured interviews with 10 experienced lyricists, we identified four key stages: Theme Setting, Ideation, Drafting Lyrics, and Melody Fitting. CoLyricist addresses these needs by incorporating tailored AI-driven support for each stage, optimizing the lyric writing process to be more seamless and efficient.</description>

<description>Multimodal recommender systems (MMRSs) enhance collaborative filtering by leveraging item-side modalities, but their reliance on a fixed set of modalities and task-specific objectives limits both modality extensibility and task generalization. We propose E-MMKGR, a framework that constructs an e-commerce-specific Multimodal Knowledge Graph E-MMKG and learns unified item representations through GNN-based propagation and KG-oriented optimization. These representations provide a shared semantic foundation applicable to diverse tasks. Experiments on real-world Amazon datasets show improvements of up to 10.18% in Recall@10 for recommendation and up to 21.72% over vector-based retrieval for product search, demonstrating the effectiveness and extensibility of our approach.</description>

However, a fundamental parametric gap remains: existing models rely on descriptive language, whereas professional workflows require precise numeric control over object location, size, and color. In this work, we introduce BBQ, a large-scale text-to-image model that directly conditions on numeric bounding boxes and RGB triplets within a unified structured-text framework. We obtain precise spatial and chromatic control by training on captions enriched with parametric annotations, without architectural modifications or inference-time optimization. This also enables intuitive user interfaces such as object dragging and color pickers, replacing ambiguous iterative prompting with precise, familiar controls. Across comprehensive evaluations, BBQ achieves strong box alignment and improves RGB color fidelity over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

<title>SEF-MAP: Subspace-Decomposed Expert Fusion for Robust Multimodal HD Map Prediction</title>

<guid>title:sef map subspace decomposed expert fusion for robust multimodal hd map prediction</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:32:23 +0000</pubDate>
<description>High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, yet multi-modal fusion often suffers from inconsistency between camera and LiDAR modalities, leading to performance degradation under low-light conditions, occlusions, or sparse point clouds. To address this, we propose SEFMAP, a Subspace-Expert Fusion framework for robust multimodal HD map prediction. The key idea is to explicitly disentangle BEV features into four semantic subspaces: LiDAR-private, Image-private, Shared, and Interaction. Each subspace is assigned a dedicated expert, thereby preserving modality-specific cues while capturing cross-modal consensus. To adaptively combine expert outputs, we introduce an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism at the BEV-cell level, where unreliable experts are down-weighted based on predictive variance, complemented by a usage balance regularizer to prevent expert collapse. To enhance robustness in degraded conditions and promote role specialization, we further propose distribution-aware masking: during training, modality-drop scenarios are simulated using EMA-statistical surrogate features, and a specialization loss enforces distinct behaviors of private, shared, and interaction experts across complete and masked inputs.</description>

<title>Large Language Model-Assisted UAV Operations and Communications: A Multifaceted Survey and Tutorial</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.19534</link>
<guid>title:large language model assisted uav operations and communications a multifaceted survey and tutorial</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:56:43 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely deployed across diverse applications due to their mobility and agility. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative opportunity to enhance UAV intelligence beyond conventional optimization-based and learning-based approaches. By integrating LLMs into UAV systems, advanced environmental understanding, swarm coordination, mobility optimization, and high-level task reasoning can be achieved, thereby allowing more adaptive and context-aware aerial operations. This survey systematically explores the intersection of LLMs and UAV technologies and proposes a unified framework that consolidates existing architectures, methodologies, and applications for UAVs. We first present a structured taxonomy of LLM adaptation techniques for UAVs, including pretraining, fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, along with key reasoning capabilities such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We then examine LLM-assisted UAV communications and operations, covering navigation, mission planning, swarm control, safety, autonomy, and network management.</description>

<description>Also available in markdown at theMultiplicity. ai/blog/schelling-goodness . This post explores a notion I'll call Schelling goodness . Claims of Schelling goodness are not first-order moral verdicts like &quot;X is good&quot; or &quot;X is bad. &quot; They are claims about a class of hypothetical coordination games in the sense of Thomas Schelling, where the task being coordinated on is a moral verdict. In each such game, participants aim to give the same response regarding a moral question, by reasoning about what a very diverse population of intelligent beings would converge on, using only broadly shared constraints: common knowledge of the question at hand, and background knowledge from the survival and growth pressures that shape successful civilizations.</description>

<description>Basic chunking gets you a demo. Hybrid search, reranking with the Vertex AI Ranking API, metadata filtering, and tuned retrieval configs turn a RAG Engine corpus into a production system. All wired through Terraform and the Python SDK. In RAG Post 1 , we deployed a Vertex AI RAG Engine corpus with basic fixed-size chunking. It works, but retrieval quality is mediocre. Your users ask nuanced questions and get incomplete or irrelevant answers back.</description>

<description>Authors: Aditya Singh*, Gerson Kroiz*, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda Aditya and Gerson are co-first authors. This work was conducted during MATS 9. 0 and was advised by Senthooran Rajamanoharan and Neel Nanda. Motivation Imagine that a frontier lab’s coding agent has been caught putting a bug in the key code for monitoring what that agent does. Naively, this seems like a clear smoking gun that the agent is scheming. But LLMs often do weird things; they could easily just be confused, or have made a mistake.</description>

<description>Agentic Engineering Patterns &amp;gt; When we lose track of how code written by our agents works we take on cognitive debt . For a lot of things this doesn't matter: if the code fetches some data from a database and outputs it as JSON the implementation details are likely simple enough that we don't need to care. We can try out the new feature and make a very solid guess at how it works, then glance over the code to be sure. Often though the details really do matter. If the core of our application becomes a black box that we don't fully understand we can no longer confidently reason about it, which makes planning new features harder and eventually slows our progress in the same way that accumulated technical debt does. How do we pay down cognitive debt?</description>

<title>Project Vend: Phase two</title>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:23 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<description>I've been on a mission to build the smallest possible versions of the UI widgets every website needs — things like a WhatsApp chat button, a cookie banner, a toast notification system. The constraint: zero dependencies, one script tag, works anywhere. Six widgets later, here's what actually surprised me. 1. WhatsApp Floating Button The widget: A floating button that opens a WhatsApp chat with a pre-filled message. Optional popup card with agent name, avatar, and online indicator.</description>

<description>Image Generate by ChatGPT The role of embeddings in how LLMs turn your words into numbers, and why those numbers capture meaning. Large language models do not read words. They read numbers. Every word, every sentence, every paragraph that flows through a model like GPT-5 or LLaMA is first converted into a dense numerical representation called an embedding. That conversion is not a formality. It is where meaning begins.</description>

<description>In 2025, if you walked into any AI conference, you may hear the same gospel: faster inference, longer context windows, cheaper inference costs. It's as if we've spent years perfecting the hammer, making it lighter, stronger, more precisely balanced, while never questioning the fact that the carpenter still has only two hands and twenty-four hours in a day. Now, Kimi introduces Agent Swarm. It is not a better hammer. It is a reconstruction of the entire workshop.</description>

<title>Signs of introspection in large language models</title>

<guid>title:signs of introspection in large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 08:43:26 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Have you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so? Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability.</description>

<description>The Economic Research team studies how AI is reshaping the economy, including work, productivity, and economic opportunity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, we track AI's real-world economic effects and publish research that helps policymakers, businesses, and the public understand and prepare for the changes ahead. We build the empirical foundation for understanding AI's economic impact. Our flagship Anthropic Economic Index tracks how AI tools are actually being used around the world and across every sector of the economy—moving beyond speculation to measure adoption patterns as they unfold. Alongside our index reports, we produce novel research that studies the implications of AI usage and diffusion—as tracked in the index—for workers, for firms, and for the broader economy. Economic transitions create both opportunity and disruption.</description>

<description>Future AI systems will be even more powerful than today’s, likely in ways that break key assumptions behind current safety techniques. That’s why it’s important to develop sophisticated safeguards to ensure models remain helpful, honest, and harmless. The Alignment team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely. Alignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own. Alignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.</description>
