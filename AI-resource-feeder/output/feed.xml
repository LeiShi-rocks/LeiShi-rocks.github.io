<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 06:55:48 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The rapid advancement of AI-powered smart glasses, one of the hottest wearable devices, has unlocked new frontiers for multimodal interaction, with Visual Question Answering (VQA) over external knowledge sources emerging as a core application. Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) adapted to smart glasses are typically trained and evaluated on traditional multimodal datasets; however, these datasets lack the variety and realism needed to reflect smart glasses usage scenarios and diverge from their specific challenges, where accurately identifying the object of interest must precede any external knowledge retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce SUPERGLASSES, the first comprehensive VQA benchmark built on real-world data entirely collected by smart glasses devices. SUPERGLASSES comprises 2,422 egocentric image-question pairs spanning 14 image domains and 8 query categories, enriched with full search trajectories and reasoning annotations. We evaluate 26 representative VLMs on this benchmark, revealing significant performance gaps. To address the limitations of existing models, we further propose SUPERLENS, a multimodal smart glasses agent that enables retrieval-augmented answer generation by integrating automatic object detection, query decoupling, and multimodal web search.</description>

<title>When to Act, Ask, or Learn: Uncertainty-Aware Policy Steering</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22474</link>
<guid>title:when to act ask or learn uncertainty aware policy steering</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 23:23:22 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Policy steering is an emerging way to adapt robot behaviors at deployment-time: a learned verifier analyzes low-level action samples proposed by a pre-trained policy (e. g. , diffusion policy) and selects only those aligned with the task. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are promising general-purpose verifiers due to their reasoning capabilities, existing frameworks often assume these models are well-calibrated. In practice, the overconfident judgment from VLM can degrade the steering performance under both high-level semantic uncertainty in task specifications and low-level action uncertainty or incapability of the pre-trained policy. We propose uncertainty-aware policy steering (UPS), a framework that jointly reasons about semantic task uncertainty and low-level action feasibility, and selects an uncertainty resolution strategy: execute a high-confidence action, clarify task ambiguity via natural language queries, or ask for action interventions to correct the low-level policy when it is deemed incapable at the task.</description>

<guid>title:anthropic acquires vercept to advance claude s computer use capabilities</guid>
<pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 08:41:32 +0000</pubDate>
<description>People are using Claude for increasingly complex work—writing and running code across entire repositories, synthesizing research from dozens of sources, and managing workflows that span multiple tools and teams. Computer use enables Claude to do all of that inside live applications, the way a person at a keyboard would. That means Claude can take on multi-step tasks in live applications, and solve problems impossible with code alone. Today, we're announcing that Anthropic has acquired Vercept to help us push those capabilities further. Vercept was built around a clear thesis: making AI genuinely useful for completing complex tasks requires solving hard perception and interaction problems. The Vercept team—including co-founders Kiana Ehsani, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick—have spent years thinking carefully about how AI systems can see and act within the same software humans use every day.</description>

<description>Earlier today, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth shared on X that he is directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a supply chain risk. This action follows months of negotiations that reached an impasse over two exceptions we requested to the lawful use of our AI model, Claude: the mass domestic surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons. We have not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations. We have tried in good faith to reach an agreement with the Department of War, making clear that we support all lawful uses of AI for national security aside from the two narrow exceptions above. To the best of our knowledge, these exceptions have not affected a single government mission to date.</description>

<guid>title:instruction based image editing with planning reasoning and generation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 04:56:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Editing images via instruction provides a natural way to generate interactive content, but it is a big challenge due to the higher requirement of scene understanding and generation. Prior work utilizes a chain of large language models, object segmentation models, and editing models for this task. However, the understanding models provide only a single modality ability, restricting the editing quality. We aim to bridge understanding and generation via a new multi-modality model that provides the intelligent abilities to instruction-based image editing models for more complex cases. To achieve this goal, we individually separate the instruction editing task with the multi-modality chain of thought prompts, i. e.</description>

<guid>title:detecting and preventing distillation attacks</guid>
<pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 08:41:34 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We have identified industrial-scale campaigns by three AI laboratories—DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax—to illicitly extract Claude’s capabilities to improve their own models. These labs generated over 16 million exchanges with Claude through approximately 24,000 fraudulent accounts, in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions. These labs used a technique called “distillation,” which involves training a less capable model on the outputs of a stronger one. Distillation is a widely used and legitimate training method. For example, frontier AI labs routinely distill their own models to create smaller, cheaper versions for their customers. But distillation can also be used for illicit purposes: competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently.</description>

<pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 08:41:34 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We’re releasing the third version of our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), the voluntary framework we use to mitigate catastrophic risks from AI systems. Anthropic has now had an RSP for more than two years, and we’ve learned a great deal about its benefits and its shortcomings. We’re therefore updating the policy to reinforce what has worked well to date, improve the policy where necessary, and implement new measures to increase the transparency and accountability of our decision-making. You can read the new RSP in full here . In this post, we’ll discuss some of the thinking behind the changes.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 08:41:22 +0000</pubDate>
<description>I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community. We were the first frontier AI company to deploy our models in the US government’s classified networks, the first to deploy them at the National Laboratories , and the first to provide custom models for national security customers. Claude is extensively deployed across the Department of War and other national security agencies for mission-critical applications, such as intelligence analysis, modeling and simulation, operational planning, cyber operations, and more. Anthropic has also acted to defend America’s lead in AI, even when it is against the company’s short-term interest. We chose to forgo several hundred million dollars in revenue to cut off the use of Claude by firms linked to the Chinese Communist Party (some of whom have been designated by the Department of War as Chinese Military Companies), shut down CCP-sponsored cyberattacks that attempted to abuse Claude, and have advocated for strong export controls on chips to ensure a democratic advantage.</description>

<title>AgentSentry: Mitigating Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents via Temporal Causal Diagnostics and Context Purification</title>

<guid>title:agentsentry mitigating indirect prompt injection in llm agents via temporal causal diagnostics and context purification</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 07:59:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools and retrieval systems to autonomously complete complex tasks. However, this design exposes agents to indirect prompt injection (IPI), where attacker-controlled context embedded in tool outputs or retrieved content silently steers agent actions away from user intent. Unlike prompt-based attacks, IPI unfolds over multi-turn trajectories, making malicious control difficult to disentangle from legitimate task execution. Existing inference-time defenses primarily rely on heuristic detection and conservative blocking of high-risk actions, which can prematurely terminate workflows or broadly suppress tool usage under ambiguous multi-turn scenarios. We propose AgentSentry, a novel inference-time detection and mitigation framework for tool-augmented LLM agents. To the best of our knowledge, AgentSentry is the first inference-time defense to model multi-turn IPI as a temporal causal takeover.</description>

<guid>title:world guidance world modeling in condition space for action generation</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 15:27:09 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Leveraging future observation modeling to facilitate action generation presents a promising avenue for enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. However, existing approaches struggle to strike a balance between maintaining efficient, predictable future representations and preserving sufficient fine-grained information to guide precise action generation. To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities. Moreover, it learns effectively from substantial human manipulation videos.</description>

<title>RADAR: Reasoning as Discrimination with Aligned Representations for LLM-based Knowledge Graph Reasoning</title>

<guid>title:radar reasoning as discrimination with aligned representations for llm based knowledge graph reasoning</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 14:34:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) infers missing facts, with recent advances increasingly harnessing the semantic priors and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing generative paradigms are prone to memorizing surface-level co-occurrences rather than learning genuine relational semantics, limiting out-of-distribution generalization. To address this, we propose RADAR, which reformulates KGR from generative pattern matching to discriminative relational reasoning. We recast KGR as discriminative entity selection, where reinforcement learning enforces relative entity separability beyond token-likelihood imitation. Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations. Across four benchmarks, RADAR achieves 5-6% relative gains on link prediction and triple classification over strong LLM baselines, while increasing task-relevant mutual information in intermediate representations by 62.</description>

<guid>title:crystal spontaneous emergence of visual latents in mllms</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 15:01:30 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by integrating powerful language backbones with large-scale visual encoders. Among these, latent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods enable implicit reasoning in continuous hidden states, facilitating seamless vision-language integration and faster inference. However, existing heuristically predefined supervision signals in latent CoT provide limited guidance for preserving critical visual information in intermediate latent states. To address this limitation, we propose CrystaL (Crystallized Latent Reasoning), a single-stage framework with two paths to process intact and corrupted images, respectively. By explicitly aligning the attention patterns and prediction distributions across the two paths, CrystaL crystallizes latent representations into task-relevant visual semantics, without relying on auxiliary annotations or external modules. Extensive experiments on perception-intensive benchmarks demonstrate that CrystaL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving substantial gains in fine-grained visual understanding while maintaining robust reasoning capabilities.</description>

<title>Beyond Refusal: Probing the Limits of Agentic Self-Correction for Semantic Sensitive Information</title>

<guid>title:beyond refusal probing the limits of agentic self correction for semantic sensitive information</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 02:09:23 +0000</pubDate>
<description>While defenses for structured PII are mature, Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new threat: Semantic Sensitive Information (SemSI), where models infer sensitive identity attributes, generate reputation-harmful content, or hallucinate potentially wrong information. The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic &quot;Editor&quot; iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34. 6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9. 8%.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 17:11:49 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Small language models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in cost, latency, and adaptability, but have so far lagged behind larger models on long-horizon software engineering tasks such as SWE-bench, where they suffer from pervasive action looping and low resolution rates. We introduce SWE-Protégé, a post-training framework that reframes software repair as an expert-protégé collaboration problem. In SWE-Protégé, an SLM remains the sole decision-maker while learning to selectively seek guidance from a strong expert model, recognize stalled states, and follow through on expert feedback. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on expert-augmented trajectories with agentic reinforcement learning that explicitly discourages degenerative looping and unproductive expert collaboration. We lightly post-train Qwen2. 5-Coder-7B-Instruct to achieve 42.</description>

<title>Evaluating Proactive Risk Awareness of Large Language Models</title>

<guid>title:evaluating proactive risk awareness of large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in everyday decision-making, their safety responsibilities extend beyond reacting to explicit harmful intent toward anticipating unintended but consequential risks. In this work, we introduce a proactive risk awareness evaluation framework that measures whether LLMs can anticipate potential harms and provide warnings before damage occurs. We construct the Butterfly dataset to instantiate this framework in the environmental and ecological domain. It contains 1,094 queries that simulate ordinary solution-seeking activities whose responses may induce latent ecological impact. Through experiments across five widely used LLMs, we analyze the effects of response length, languages, and modality. Experimental results reveal consistent, significant declines in proactive awareness under length-restricted responses, cross-lingual similarities, and persistent blind spots in (multimodal) species protection.</description>

<guid>title:topoedit fast post optimization editing of topology optimized structures</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 21:41:44 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Despite topology optimization producing high-performance structures, late-stage localized revisions remain brittle: direct density-space edits (e. g. , warping pixels, inserting holes, swapping infill) can sever load paths and sharply degrade compliance, while re-running optimization is slow and may drift toward a qualitatively different design. We present TopoEdit, a fast post-optimization editor that demonstrates how structured latent embeddings from a pre-trained topology foundation model (OAT) can be repurposed as an interface for physics-aware engineering edits. Given an optimized topology, TopoEdit encodes it into OAT's spatial latent, applies partial noising to preserve instance identity while increasing editability, and injects user intent through an edit-then-denoise diffusion pipeline. We instantiate three edit operators: drag-based topology warping with boundary-condition-consistent conditioning updates, shell-infill lattice replacement using a lattice-anchored reference latent with updated volume-fraction conditioning, and late-stage no-design region enforcement via masked latent overwrite followed by diffusion-based recovery.</description>

<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:52:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Universal graph pre-training has emerged as a key paradigm in graph representation learning, offering a promising way to train encoders to learn transferable representations from unlabeled graphs and to effectively generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation. This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.</description>

<title>UniVBench: Towards Unified Evaluation for Video Foundation Models</title>

<guid>title:univbench towards unified evaluation for video foundation models</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 12:08:53 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Video foundation models aim to integrate video understanding, generation, editing, and instruction following within a single framework, making them a central direction for next-generation multimodal systems. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks.</description>

<title>Squint: Fast Visual Reinforcement Learning for Sim-to-Real Robotics</title>

<guid>title:squint fast visual reinforcement learning for sim to real robotics</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:58:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Visual reinforcement learning is appealing for robotics but expensive -- off-policy methods are sample-efficient yet slow; on-policy methods parallelize well but waste samples. Recent work has shown that off-policy methods can train faster than on-policy methods in wall-clock time for state-based control. Extending this to vision remains challenging, where high-dimensional input images complicate training dynamics and introduce substantial storage and encoding overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Squint, a visual Soft Actor Critic method that achieves faster wall-clock training than prior visual off-policy and on-policy methods. Squint achieves this via parallel simulation, a distributional critic, resolution squinting, layer normalization, a tuned update-to-data ratio, and an optimized implementation. We evaluate on the SO-101 Task Set, a new suite of eight manipulation tasks in ManiSkill3 with heavy domain randomization, and demonstrate sim-to-real transfer to a real SO-101 robot.</description>

<title>Event-Aided Sharp Radiance Field Reconstruction for Fast-Flying Drones</title>

<guid>title:event aided sharp radiance field reconstruction for fast flying drones</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:02:56 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Fast-flying aerial robots promise rapid inspection under limited battery constraints, with direct applications in infrastructure inspection, terrain exploration, and search and rescue. However, high speeds lead to severe motion blur in images and induce significant drift and noise in pose estimates, making dense 3D reconstruction with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) particularly challenging due to their high sensitivity to such degradations. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages asynchronous event streams alongside motion-blurred frames to reconstruct high-fidelity radiance fields from agile drone flights. By embedding event-image fusion into NeRF optimization and jointly refining event-based visual-inertial odometry priors using both event and frame modalities, our method recovers sharp radiance fields and accurate camera trajectories without ground-truth supervision. We validate our approach on both synthetic data and real-world sequences captured by a fast-flying drone. Despite highly dynamic drone flights, where RGB frames are severely degraded by motion blur and pose priors become unreliable, our method reconstructs high-fidelity radiance fields and preserves fine scene details, delivering a performance gain of over 50% on real-world data compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

<guid>title:learning physical principles from interaction self evolving planning via test time memory</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 20:18:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reliable object manipulation requires understanding physical properties that vary across objects and environments. Vision-language model (VLM) planners can reason about friction and stability in general terms; however, they often cannot predict how a specific ball will roll on a particular surface or which stone will provide a stable foundation without direct experience. We present PhysMem, a memory framework that enables VLM robot planners to learn physical principles from interaction at test time, without updating model parameters. The system records experiences, generates candidate hypotheses, and verifies them through targeted interaction before promoting validated knowledge to guide future decisions. A central design choice is verification before application: the system tests hypotheses against new observations rather than applying retrieved experience directly, reducing rigid reliance on prior experience when physical conditions change. We evaluate PhysMem on three real-world manipulation tasks and simulation benchmarks across four VLM backbones.</description>

<title>HELP: HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization for Accurate and Efficient GraphRAG</title>

<guid>title:help hypernode expansion and logical path guided evidence localization for accurate and efficient graphrag</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 14:05:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with inherent knowledge boundaries and hallucinations, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues, it frequently overlooks structural interdependencies essential for multi-hop reasoning. Graph-based RAG approaches attempt to bridge this gap, yet they typically face trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency due to challenges such as costly graph traversals and semantic noise in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we propose HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization strategies for GraphRAG (HELP), a novel framework designed to balance accuracy with practical efficiency through two core strategies: 1) HyperNode Expansion, which iteratively chains knowledge triplets into coherent reasoning paths abstracted as HyperNodes to capture complex structural dependencies and ensure retrieval accuracy; and 2) Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization, which leverages precomputed graph-text correlations to map these paths directly to the corpus for superior efficiency. HELP avoids expensive random walks and semantic distortion, preserving knowledge integrity while drastically reducing retrieval latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HELP achieves competitive performance across multiple simple and multi-hop QA benchmarks and up to a 28.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 21:57:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Despite frequent double-blind review, systemic biases related to author demographics still disadvantage underrepresented groups. We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e. g. , race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases.</description>

<guid>title:enhancing multilingual embeddings via multi way parallel text alignment</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 03:58:24 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multilingual pretraining typically lacks explicit alignment signals, leading to suboptimal cross-lingual alignment in the representation space. In this work, we show that training standard pretrained models for cross-lingual alignment with a multi-way parallel corpus in a diverse pool of languages can substantially improve multilingual and cross-lingual representations for NLU tasks. We construct a multi-way parallel dataset using translations of English text from an off-the-shelf NMT model for a pool of six target languages and achieve strong cross-lingual alignment through contrastive learning. This leads to substantial performance gains across both seen and unseen languages for multiple tasks from the MTEB benchmark evaluated for XLM-Roberta and multilingual BERT base models. Using a multi-way parallel corpus for contrastive training yields substantial gains on bitext mining (21. 3%), semantic similarity (5.</description>

<title>Counterfactual Simulation Training for Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.20710</link>
<guid>title:counterfactual simulation training for chain of thought faithfulness</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:15:30 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Inspecting Chain-of-Thought reasoning is among the most common means of understanding why an LLM produced its output. But well-known problems with CoT faithfulness severely limit what insights can be gained from this practice. In this paper, we introduce a training method called Counterfactual Simulation Training (CST), which aims to improve CoT faithfulness by rewarding CoTs that enable a simulator to accurately predict a model's outputs over counterfactual inputs. We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST.</description>

<title>Testable Learning of General Halfspaces under Massart Noise</title>

<guid>title:testable learning of general halfspaces under massart noise</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 18:30:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We study the algorithmic task of testably learning general Massart halfspaces under the Gaussian distribution. In the testable learning setting, the aim is the design of a tester-learner pair satisfying the following properties: (1) if the tester accepts, the learner outputs a hypothesis and a certificate that it achieves near-optimal error, and (2) it is highly unlikely that the tester rejects if the data satisfies the underlying assumptions. Our main result is the first testable learning algorithm for general halfspaces with Massart noise and Gaussian marginals. The complexity of our algorithm is $d^{\mathrm{polylog}(\min\{1/γ, 1/ε\})}$, where $ε$ is the excess error and $γ$ is the bias of the target halfspace, which qualitatively matches the known quasi-polynomial Statistical Query lower bound for the non-testable setting. The analysis of our algorithm hinges on a novel sandwiching polynomial approximation to the sign function with multiplicative error that may be of broader interest.</description>

<title>iMiGUE-Speech: A Spontaneous Speech Dataset for Affective Analysis</title>

<guid>title:imigue speech a spontaneous speech dataset for affective analysis</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 00:38:19 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This work presents iMiGUE-Speech, an extension of the iMiGUE dataset that provides a spontaneous affective corpus for studying emotional and affective states. The new release focuses on speech and enriches the original dataset with additional metadata, including speech transcripts, speaker-role separation between interviewer and interviewee, and word-level forced alignments. Unlike existing emotional speech datasets that rely on acted or laboratory-elicited emotions, iMiGUE-Speech captures spontaneous affect arising naturally from real match outcomes. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset and establish initial benchmarks, we introduce two evaluation tasks for comparative assessment: speech emotion recognition and transcript-based sentiment analysis. These tasks leverage state-of-the-art pre-trained representations to assess the dataset's ability to capture spontaneous affective states from both acoustic and linguistic modalities. iMiGUE-Speech can also be synchronously paired with micro-gesture annotations from the original iMiGUE dataset, forming a uniquely multimodal resource for studying speech-gesture affective dynamics.</description>

<guid>title:revisiting text ranking in deep research</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 00:18:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Deep research has emerged as an important task that aims to address hard queries through extensive open-web exploration. To tackle it, most prior work equips large language model (LLM)-based agents with opaque web search APIs, enabling agents to iteratively issue search queries, retrieve external evidence, and reason over it. Despite search's essential role in deep research, black-box web search APIs hinder systematic analysis of search components, leaving the behaviour of established text ranking methods in deep research largely unclear. To fill this gap, we reproduce a selection of key findings and best practices for IR text ranking methods in the deep research setting. In particular, we examine their effectiveness from three perspectives: (i) retrieval units (documents vs. passages), (ii) pipeline configurations (different retrievers, re-rankers, and re-ranking depths), and (iii) query characteristics (the mismatch between agent-issued queries and the training queries of text rankers).</description>

<guid>title:the diffusion duality chapter ii samplers and efficient curriculum</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:35:22 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Uniform-state discrete diffusion models excel at few-step generation and guidance due to their ability to self-correct, making them preferred over autoregressive or Masked diffusion models in these settings. However, their sampling quality plateaus with ancestral samplers as the number of steps increases. We introduce a family of Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers for discrete diffusion that generalize prior methods and apply to arbitrary noise processes. When paired with uniform-state diffusion, our samplers outperform ancestral sampling on both language and image modeling, achieving lower generative perplexity at matched unigram entropy on OpenWebText and better FID/IS scores on CIFAR10. Crucially, unlike conventional samplers, our PC methods continue to improve with more sampling steps. Taken together, these findings call into question the assumption that Masked diffusion is the inevitable future of diffusion-based language modeling.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:28:08 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Deep learning has significantly advanced automated brain tumor diagnosis, yet clinical adoption remains limited by interpretability and computational constraints. Conventional models often act as opaque ''black boxes'' and fail to quantify the complex, irregular tumor boundaries that characterize malignant growth. To address these challenges, we present XMorph, an explainable and computationally efficient framework for fine-grained classification of three prominent brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. We propose an Information-Weighted Boundary Normalization (IWBN) mechanism that emphasizes diagnostically relevant boundary regions alongside nonlinear chaotic and clinically validated features, enabling a richer morphological representation of tumor growth. A dual-channel explainable AI module combines GradCAM++ visual cues with LLM-generated textual rationales, translating model reasoning into clinically interpretable insights. The proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 96.</description>

<guid>title:mmwave radar aware dual conditioned gan for speech reconstruction of signals with low snr</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 21:43:38 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar captures are band-limited and noisy, making for difficult reconstruction of intelligible full-bandwidth speech. In this work, we propose a two-stage speech reconstruction pipeline for mmWave using a Radar-Aware Dual-conditioned Generative Adversarial Network (RAD-GAN), which is capable of performing bandwidth extension on signals with low signal-to-noise ratios (-5 dB to -1 dB), captured through glass walls. We propose an mmWave-tailored Multi-Mel Discriminator (MMD) and a Residual Fusion Gate (RFG) to enhance the generator input to process multiple conditioning channels. The proposed two-stage pipeline involves pretraining the model on synthetically clipped clean speech and finetuning on fused mel spectrograms generated by the RFG. We empirically show that the proposed method, trained on a limited dataset, with no pre-trained modules, and no data augmentations, outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for this specific task. Audio examples of RAD-GAN are available online at https://rad-gan-demo-site.</description>

<guid>title:learning recursive multi scale representations for irregular multivariate time series forecasting</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 02:14:42 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) are characterized by uneven intervals between consecutive timestamps, which carry sampling pattern information valuable and informative for learning temporal and variable dependencies. In addition, IMTS often exhibit diverse dependencies across multiple time scales. However, many existing multi-scale IMTS methods use resampling to obtain the coarse series, which can alter the original timestamps and disrupt the sampling pattern information. To address the challenge, we propose ReIMTS, a Recursive multi-scale modeling approach for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Instead of resampling, ReIMTS keeps timestamps unchanged and recursively splits each sample into subsamples with progressively shorter time periods. Based on the original sampling timestamps in these long-to-short subsamples, an irregularity-aware representation fusion mechanism is proposed to capture global-to-local dependencies for accurate forecasting.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 17:01:52 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Neural networks (NNs) are pervasive across various domains but often lack interpretability. To address the growing need for explanations, logic-based approaches have been proposed to explain predictions made by NNs, offering correctness guarantees. However, scalability remains a concern in these methods. This paper proposes an approach leveraging domain slicing to facilitate explanation generation for NNs. By reducing the complexity of logical constraints through slicing, we decrease explanation time by up to 40\% less time, as indicated through comparative experiments. Our findings highlight the efficacy of domain slicing in enhancing explanation efficiency for NNs.</description>

<description>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be vulnerable to adversarial images that subtly bias their outputs toward plausible yet incorrect responses. We introduce a general, efficient, and training-free defense that combines image transformations with agentic data consolidation to recover correct model behavior. A key component of our approach is a two-stage detection mechanism that quickly filters out the majority of clean inputs. We first assess image consistency under content-preserving transformations at negligible computational cost. For more challenging cases, we examine discrepancies in a text-embedding space. Only when necessary do we invoke a powerful LLM to resolve attack-induced divergences.</description>

<title>Multi-Level Causal Embeddings</title>

<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 14:14:13 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Abstractions of causal models allow for the coarsening of models such that relations of cause and effect are preserved. Whereas abstractions focus on the relation between two models, in this paper we study a framework for causal embeddings which enable multiple detailed models to be mapped into sub-systems of a coarser causal model. We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency. By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations.</description>

<title>Schelling Goodness, and Shared Morality as a Goal</title>

<pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 04:25:42 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Also available in markdown at theMultiplicity. ai/blog/schelling-goodness . This post explores a notion I'll call Schelling goodness . Claims of Schelling goodness are not first-order moral verdicts like &quot;X is good&quot; or &quot;X is bad. &quot; They are claims about a class of hypothetical coordination games in the sense of Thomas Schelling, where the task being coordinated on is a moral verdict. In each such game, participants aim to give the same response regarding a moral question, by reasoning about what a very diverse population of intelligent beings would converge on, using only broadly shared constraints: common knowledge of the question at hand, and background knowledge from the survival and growth pressures that shape successful civilizations.</description>

<description>Authors: Aditya Singh*, Gerson Kroiz*, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda Aditya and Gerson are co-first authors. This work was conducted during MATS 9. 0 and was advised by Senthooran Rajamanoharan and Neel Nanda. Motivation Imagine that a frontier lab’s coding agent has been caught putting a bug in the key code for monitoring what that agent does. Naively, this seems like a clear smoking gun that the agent is scheming. But LLMs often do weird things; they could easily just be confused, or have made a mistake.</description>

<title>Search-P1: Path-Centric Reward Shaping for Stable and Efficient Agentic RAG Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22576</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.22576</guid>
<pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602.22576v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, yet traditional single-round retrieval struggles with complex multi-step reasoning. Agentic RAG addresses this by enabling LLMs to dynamically decide when and what to retrieve, but current RL-based training methods suffer from sparse outcome rewards that discard intermediate signals and low sample efficiency where failed samples contribute nothing. We propose Search-P1, a framework that introduces path-centric reward shaping for agentic RAG training, comprising two key components: (1) Path-Centric Reward, which evaluates the structural quality of reasoning trajectories through order-agnostic step coverage and soft scoring that extracts learning signals even from failed samples, and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring with offline-generated reference planners that assesses paths from both self-consistency and reference-alignment perspectives. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that Search-P1 achieves significant improvements over Search-R1 and other strong baselines, with an average accuracy gain of 7.7 points.</description>

<title>Imagination Helps Visual Reasoning, But Not Yet in Latent Space</title>

<pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 22766v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Latent visual reasoning aims to mimic human's imagination process by meditating through hidden states of Multimodal Large Language Models. While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. Motivated to demystify the true source of its efficacy, we investigate the validity of latent reasoning using Causal Mediation Analysis. We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence.</description>

<title>Assessing Deanonymization Risks with Stylometry-Assisted LLM Agent</title>

<description>arXiv:2602. 23079v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled powerful authorship inference capabilities, raising growing concerns about unintended deanonymization risks in textual data such as news articles. In this work, we introduce an LLM agent designed to evaluate and mitigate such risks through a structured, interpretable pipeline. Central to our framework is the proposed $\textit{SALA}$ (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis) method, which integrates quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning for robust and transparent authorship attribution. Experiments on large-scale news datasets demonstrate that $\textit{SALA}$, particularly when augmented with a database module, achieves high inference accuracy in various scenarios. Finally, we propose a guided recomposition strategy that leverages the agent's reasoning trace to generate rewriting prompts, effectively reducing authorship identifiability while preserving textual meaning.</description>

<description>arXiv:2602. 22897v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e. g. , vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities.</description>

<title>Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25992</link>

<pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2510. 25992v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical &quot;actions&quot;. SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner.</description>

<description>While everyone is busy discussing what AI might replace, few have noticed that AI is making one specific technology more critical than ever before: APIs. A Counterintuitive Fact The users calling your APIs are no longer just programmers sitting in front of their computers; they are increasingly AI Agents working 24/7 without rest. OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, as well as Meta's Llama, Mistral, and Grok--they are all incredibly intelligent. They can write code, analyze data, and engage in human-like dialogue. But if you think about it carefully, they share one common and fatal limitation: They know everything, but they can't do anything. An AI model cannot help you place an order, transfer funds, or modify a single record in a database.</description>

<title>Search More, Think Less: Rethinking Long-Horizon Agentic Search for Efficiency and Generalization</title>

<description>arXiv:2602. 22675v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent deep research agents primarily improve performance by scaling reasoning depth, but this leads to high inference cost and latency in search-intensive scenarios. Moreover, generalization across heterogeneous research settings remains challenging. In this work, we propose \emph{Search More, Think Less} (SMTL), a framework for long-horizon agentic search that targets both efficiency and generalization. SMTL replaces sequential reasoning with parallel evidence acquisition, enabling efficient context management under constrained context budgets. To support generalization across task types, we further introduce a unified data synthesis pipeline that constructs search tasks spanning both deterministic question answering and open-ended research scenarios with task appropriate evaluation metrics.</description>

<title>Effective QA-driven Annotation of Predicate-Argument Relations Across Languages</title>

<description>arXiv:2602. 22865v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Explicit representations of predicate-argument relations form the basis of interpretable semantic analysis, supporting reasoning, generation, and evaluation. However, attaining such semantic structures requires costly annotation efforts and has remained largely confined to English. We leverage the Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) framework -- a natural-language formulation of predicate-argument relations -- as the foundation for extending semantic annotation to new languages. To this end, we introduce a cross-linguistic projection approach that reuses an English QA-SRL parser within a constrained translation and word-alignment pipeline to automatically generate question-answer annotations aligned with target-language predicates. Applied to Hebrew, Russian, and French -- spanning diverse language families -- the method yields high-quality training data and fine-tuned, language-specific parsers that outperform strong multilingual LLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaMA-Maverick).</description>

<title>Test-Time Scaling with Diffusion Language Models via Reward-Guided Stitching</title>

<description>arXiv:2602. 22871v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Reasoning with large language models often benefits from generating multiple chains-of-thought, but existing aggregation strategies are typically trajectory-level (e. g. , selecting the best trace or voting on the final answer), discarding useful intermediate work from partial or &quot;nearly correct&quot; attempts. We propose Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, a self-consistency framework that turns cheap diffusion-sampled reasoning into a reusable pool of step-level candidates. Given a problem, we (i) sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, (ii) score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM), and (iii) stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale.</description>

<title>Modality Collapse as Mismatched Decoding: Information-Theoretic Limits of Multimodal LLMs</title>

<description>arXiv:2602. 23136v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Multimodal LLMs can process speech and images, but they cannot hear a speaker's voice or see an object's texture. We show this is not a failure of encoding: speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes survive through every LLM layer (3--55$\times$ above chance in linear probes), yet removing 64--71% of modality-specific variance improves decoder loss. The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise. We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity.</description>

<title>Why Diffusion Language Models Struggle with Truly Parallel (Non-Autoregressive) Decoding?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23225</link>

<description>arXiv:2602. 23225v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are often advertised as enabling parallel token generation, yet practical fast DLMs frequently converge to left-to-right, autoregressive (AR)-like decoding dynamics. In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates.</description>

<title>Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response for Low-Latency Spoken Dialogue Systems</title>

<description>arXiv:2602. 23266v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Achieving human-like responsiveness is a critical yet challenging goal for cascaded spoken dialogue systems. Conventional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines follow a strictly sequential paradigm, requiring complete transcription and full reasoning before speech synthesis can begin, which results in high response latency. We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs. Experiments on two spoken dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that DDTSR reduces response latency by 19%-51% while preserving discourse quality.</description>

<description>arXiv:2602. 23351v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The lack of reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has remained at the forefront of research discourse. We posit that this behavior stems from a reporting bias in their training data. That is, how people communicate about visual content by default omits tacit information needed to supervise some types of reasoning; e. g. , &quot;at the game today!</description>

<title>VeRO: An Evaluation Harness for Agents to Optimize Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22480</link>

<description>arXiv:2602. 22480v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: An important emerging application of coding agents is agent optimization: the iterative improvement of a target agent through edit-execute-evaluate cycles. Despite its relevance, the community lacks a systematic understanding of coding agent performance on this task. Agent optimization differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering: the target agent interleaves deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions, requiring structured capture of both intermediate reasoning and downstream execution outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance.</description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) enable promising solutions to this problem, with operator-centric solutions that generate table manipulation pipelines in a multi-step manner offering state-of-the-art performance. However, these solutions rely on multiple LLM calls, resulting in prohibitive latencies and computational costs.

<title>Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought with Jacobi Iteration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18582</link>

<description>arXiv:2506. 18582v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Continuous chain-of-thought has been shown to be effective in saving reasoning tokens for large language models. By reasoning with continuous latent thought tokens, continuous CoT is able to perform implicit reasoning in a compact manner. However, the sequential dependencies between latent thought tokens spoil parallel training, leading to long training time. In this paper, we propose Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought (PCCoT), which performs Jacobi iteration on the latent thought tokens, updating them iteratively in parallel instead of sequentially and thus improving both training and inference efficiency of continuous CoT. Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the proper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better performance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.</description>
