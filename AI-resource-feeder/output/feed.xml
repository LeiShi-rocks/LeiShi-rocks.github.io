<title>Recursive Belief Vision Language Model</title>

<description>Current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with long-horizon manipulation under partial observability. Most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. Semantic reasoning alone is not the primary bottleneck in long-horizon manipulation. Instead, VLAs lack persistent, action-conditioned state representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions.</description>

<title>Efficient and Explainable End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion</title>

<guid>title:efficient and explainable end to end autonomous driving via masked vision language action diffusion</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:59:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising candidates for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, these models typically face challenges in inference latency, action precision, and explainability. Existing autoregressive approaches struggle with slow token-by-token generation, while prior diffusion-based planners often rely on verbose, general-purpose language tokens that lack explicit geometric structure. In this work, we propose Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion for Autonomous Driving (MVLAD-AD), a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between efficient planning and semantic explainability via a masked vision-language-action diffusion model. Unlike methods that force actions into the language space, we introduce a discrete action tokenization strategy that constructs a compact codebook of kinematically feasible waypoints from real-world driving distributions. Moreover, we propose geometry-aware embedding learning to ensure that embeddings in the latent space approximate physical geometric metrics.</description>

<title>Spa3R: Predictive Spatial Field Modeling for 3D Visual Reasoning</title>

<guid>title:spa3r predictive spatial field modeling for 3d visual reasoning</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:37:34 +0000</pubDate>
<description>While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit exceptional 2D visual understanding, their ability to comprehend and reason about 3D space--a cornerstone of spatial intelligence--remains superficial. Current methodologies attempt to bridge this domain gap either by relying on explicit 3D modalities or by augmenting VLMs with partial, view-conditioned geometric priors. However, such approaches hinder scalability and ultimately burden the language model with the ill-posed task of implicitly reconstructing holistic 3D geometry from sparse cues. In this paper, we argue that spatial intelligence can emerge inherently from 2D vision alone, rather than being imposed via explicit spatial instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Spa3R, a self-supervised framework that learns a unified, view-invariant spatial representation directly from unposed multi-view images. Spa3R is built upon the proposed Predictive Spatial Field Modeling (PSFM) paradigm, where Spa3R learns to synthesize feature fields for arbitrary unseen views conditioned on a compact latent representation, thereby internalizing a holistic and coherent understanding of the underlying 3D scene.</description>

<guid>title:a benchmark for deep information synthesis</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:43:32 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used to solve complex tasks involving tool use, such as web browsing, code execution, and data analysis. However, current evaluation benchmarks do not adequately assess their ability to solve real-world tasks that require synthesizing information from multiple sources and inferring insights beyond simple fact retrieval. To address this, we introduce DEEPSYNTH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agents on realistic, time-consuming problems that combine information gathering, synthesis, and structured reasoning to produce insights. DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries. DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers. When evaluated on DEEPSYNTH, 11 state-of-the-art LLMs and deep research agents achieve a maximum F1 score of 8.</description>

<title>BFA++: Hierarchical Best-Feature-Aware Token Prune for Multi-View Vision Language Action Model</title>

<guid>title:bfa hierarchical best feature aware token prune for multi view vision language action model</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:31:52 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) to jointly interpret instructions and visual inputs. However, the substantial increase in visual tokens, particularly from multi-view inputs, poses serious challenges to real-time robotic manipulation. Existing acceleration techniques for VLMs, such as token pruning, often result in degraded performance when directly applied to VLA models, as they overlook the relationships between different views and fail to account for the dynamic and task-specific characteristics of robotic operation. To address this, we propose BFA++, a dynamic token pruning framework designed specifically for VLA models. BFA++ introduces a hierarchical pruning strategy guided by two-level importance predictors: an intra-view predictor highlights task-relevant regions within each image to suppress spatial noise, while an inter-view predictor identifies critical camera views throughout different manipulation phases to reduce cross-view redundancy. This design enables efficient token selection while preserving essential visual cues, resulting in improved computational efficiency and higher manipulation success rates.</description>

<title>Not Just What's There: Enabling CLIP to Comprehend Negated Visual Descriptions Without Fine-tuning</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.21035</link>
<guid>title:not just what s there enabling clip to comprehend negated visual descriptions without fine tuning</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 15:55:39 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP struggle to understand negation, often embedding affirmatives and negatives similarly (e. g. , matching &quot;no dog&quot; with dog images). Existing methods refine negation understanding via fine-tuning CLIP's text encoder, risking overfitting. In this work, we propose CLIPGlasses, a plug-and-play framework that enhances CLIP's ability to comprehend negated visual descriptions. CLIPGlasses adopts a dual-stage design: a Lens module disentangles negated semantics from text embeddings, and a Frame module predicts context-aware repulsion strength, which is integrated into a modified similarity computation to penalize alignment with negated semantics, thereby reducing false positive matches.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 07:23:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>As Large Language Models (LLMs) saturate elementary benchmarks, the research frontier has shifted from generation to the reliability of automated evaluation. We demonstrate that standard &quot;LLM-as-a-Judge&quot; protocols suffer from a systematic Alignment Gap when applied to upper-undergraduate to early graduate level mathematics. To quantify this, we introduce QEDBench, the first large-scale dual-rubric alignment benchmark to systematically measure alignment with human experts on university-level math proofs by contrasting course-specific rubrics against expert common knowledge criteria. By deploying a dual-evaluation matrix (7 judges x 5 solvers) against 1,000+ hours of human evaluation, we reveal that certain frontier evaluators like Claude Opus 4. 5, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen 2. 5 Max, and Llama 4 Maverick exhibit significant positive bias (up to +0.</description>

<title>Human Video Generation from a Single Image with 3D Pose and View Control</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.21188</link>
<guid>title:human video generation from a single image with 3d pose and view control</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:42:20 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Recent diffusion methods have made significant progress in generating videos from single images due to their powerful visual generation capabilities. However, challenges persist in image-to-video synthesis, particularly in human video generation, where inferring view-consistent, motion-dependent clothing wrinkles from a single image remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control. HVG achieves this through three key designs: (i) Articulated Pose Modulation, which captures the anatomical relationships of 3D joints via a novel dual-dimensional bone map and resolves self-occlusions across views by introducing 3D information; (ii) View and Temporal Alignment, which ensures multi-view consistency and alignment between a reference image and pose sequences for frame-to-frame stability; and (iii) Progressive Spatio-Temporal Sampling with temporal alignment to maintain smooth transitions in long multi-view animations. Extensive experiments on image-to-video tasks demonstrate that HVG outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 4D human videos from diverse human images and pose inputs.</description>

<title>CG-DMER: Hybrid Contrastive-Generative Framework for Disentangled Multimodal ECG Representation Learning</title>

<guid>title:cg dmer hybrid contrastive generative framework for disentangled multimodal ecg representation learning</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:59:21 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Accurate interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is crucial for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Recent multimodal approaches that integrate ECGs with accompanying clinical reports show strong potential, but they still face two main concerns from a modality perspective: (1) intra-modality: existing models process ECGs in a lead-agnostic manner, overlooking spatial-temporal dependencies across leads, which restricts their effectiveness in modeling fine-grained diagnostic patterns; (2) inter-modality: existing methods directly align ECG signals with clinical reports, introducing modality-specific biases due to the free-text nature of the reports. In light of these two issues, we propose CG-DMER, a contrastive-generative framework for disentangled multimodal ECG representation learning, powered by two key designs: (1) Spatial-temporal masked modeling is designed to better capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and inter-lead spatial dependencies by applying masking across both spatial and temporal dimensions and reconstructing the missing information. (2) A representation disentanglement and alignment strategy is designed to mitigate unnecessary noise and modality-specific biases by introducing modality-specific and modality-shared encoders, ensuring a clearer separation between modality-invariant and modality-specific representations. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that CG-DMER achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 04:48:05 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Colony-forming unit (CFU) detection is critical in pharmaceutical manufacturing, serving as a key component of Environmental Monitoring programs and ensuring compliance with stringent quality standards. Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, while deep learning (DL) approaches, though accurate, remain vulnerable to sample quality variations and artifacts. Building on our earlier CNN-based framework (Beznik et al. , 2020), we evaluated YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 for CFU detection; however, these achieved only 97. 08 percent accuracy, insufficient for pharmaceutical-grade requirements. A custom Detectron2 model trained on GSK's dataset of over 50,000 Petri dish images achieved 99 percent detection rate with 2 percent false positives and 0.</description>

<guid>title:logicgraph benchmarking multi path logical reasoning via neuro symbolic generation and verification</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 16:04:26 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) primarily emphasize convergent logical reasoning, where success is defined by producing a single correct proof. However, many real-world reasoning problems admit multiple valid derivations, requiring models to explore diverse logical paths rather than committing to one route. To address this limitation, we introduce LogicGraph, the first benchmark aimed to systematically evaluate multi-path logical reasoning, constructed via a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages backward logic generation and semantic instantiation. This pipeline yields solver-verified reasoning problems formalized by high-depth multi-path reasoning and inherent logical distractions, where each instance is associated with an exhaustive set of minimal proofs. We further propose a reference-free evaluation framework to rigorously assess model performance in both convergent and divergent regimes. Experiments on state-of-the-art language models reveal a common limitation: models tend to commit early to a single route and fail to explore alternatives, and the coverage gap grows substantially with reasoning depth.</description>

<title>Cycle-Consistent Tuning for Layered Image Decomposition</title>

<guid>title:cycle consistent tuning for layered image decomposition</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 15:10:31 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Disentangling visual layers in real-world images is a persistent challenge in vision and graphics, as such layers often involve non-linear and globally coupled interactions, including shading, reflection, and perspective distortion. In this work, we present an in-context image decomposition framework that leverages large diffusion foundation models for layered separation. We focus on the challenging case of logo-object decomposition, where the goal is to disentangle a logo from the surface on which it appears while faithfully preserving both layers. Our method fine-tunes a pretrained diffusion model via lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a cycle-consistent tuning strategy that jointly trains decomposition and composition models, enforcing reconstruction consistency between decomposed and recomposed images. This bidirectional supervision substantially enhances robustness in cases where the layers exhibit complex interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive self-improving process, which iteratively augments the training set with high-quality model-generated examples to refine performance.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 15:01:39 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Scaling multimodal alignment between video and audio is challenging, particularly due to limited data and the mismatch between text descriptions and frame-level video information. In this work, we tackle the scaling challenge in multimodal-to-audio generation, examining whether models trained on short instances can generalize to longer ones during testing. To tackle this challenge, we present multimodal hierarchical networks so-called MMHNet, an enhanced extension of state-of-the-art video-to-audio models. Our approach integrates a hierarchical method and non-causal Mamba to support long-form audio generation. Our proposed method significantly improves long audio generation up to more than 5 minutes. We also prove that training short and testing long is possible in the video-to-audio generation tasks without training on the longer durations.</description>

<title>Toward an Agentic Infused Software Ecosystem</title>

<guid>title:toward an agentic infused software ecosystem</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 15:01:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Fully leveraging the capabilities of AI agents in software development requires a rethinking of the software ecosystem itself. To this end, this paper outlines the creation of an Agentic Infused Software Ecosystem (AISE), that rests on three pillars. The first, of course, is the AI agents themselves, which in the past 5 years have moved from simple code completion and toward sophisticated independent development tasks, a trend which will only continue. The second pillar is the programming language and APIs (or tools) that these agents use to accomplish tasks, and increasingly, serve as the communication substrate that humans and AI agents interact and collaborate through. The final pillar is the runtime environment and ecosystem that agents operate within, and which provide the capabilities that programmatic agents use to interface with (and effect actions in) the external world. To realize the vision of AISE, all three pillars must be advanced in a holistic manner, and critically, in a manner that is synergistic for AI agents as they exist today, those that will exist in the future, and for the human developers that work alongside them.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:13:05 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious instructions in retrieved content hijack the agent's execution. Existing defenses typically rely on strict filtering or refusal mechanisms, which suffer from a critical limitation: over-refusal, prematurely terminating valid agentic workflows. We propose ICON, a probing-to-mitigation framework that neutralizes attacks while preserving task continuity. Our key insight is that IPI attacks leave distinct over-focusing signatures in the latent space. We introduce a Latent Space Trace Prober to detect attacks based on high intensity scores. Subsequently, a Mitigating Rectifier performs surgical attention steering that selectively manipulate adversarial query key dependencies while amplifying task relevant elements to restore the LLM's functional trajectory.</description>

<description>Custom Storyboard Generation (CSG) aims to produce high-quality, multi-character consistent storytelling. Current approaches based on static diffusion models, whether used in a one-shot manner or within multi-agent frameworks, face three key limitations: (1) Static models lack dynamic expressiveness and often resort to &quot;copy-paste&quot; pattern. (2) One-shot inference cannot iteratively correct missing attributes or poor prompt adherence. (3) Multi-agents rely on non-robust evaluators, ill-suited for assessing stylized, non-realistic animation. To address these, we propose AnimeAgent, the first Image-to-Video (I2V)-based multi-agent framework for CSG. Inspired by Disney's &quot;Combination of Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose&quot; workflow, AnimeAgent leverages I2V's implicit motion prior to enhance consistency and expressiveness, while a mixed subjective-objective reviewer enables reliable iterative refinement.</description>

<description>Uniform-state discrete diffusion models excel at few-step generation and guidance due to their ability to self-correct, making them preferred over autoregressive or Masked diffusion models in these settings. However, their sampling quality plateaus with ancestral samplers as the number of steps increases. We introduce a family of Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers for discrete diffusion that generalize prior methods and apply to arbitrary noise processes. When paired with uniform-state diffusion, our samplers outperform ancestral sampling on both language and image modeling, achieving lower generative perplexity at matched unigram entropy on OpenWebText and better FID/IS scores on CIFAR10. Crucially, unlike conventional samplers, our PC methods continue to improve with more sampling steps. Taken together, these findings call into question the assumption that Masked diffusion is the inevitable future of diffusion-based language modeling.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:42:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large vision-language models (VLMs) have evolved from general-purpose applications to specialized use cases such as in the clinical domain, demonstrating potential for decision support in radiology. One promising application is assisting radiologists in decision-making by the analysis of radiology imaging data such as chest X-rays (CXR) via a visual and natural language question-answering (VQA) interface. When longitudinal imaging is available, radiologists analyze temporal changes, which are essential for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. The manual longitudinal analysis is a time-consuming process, motivating the development of a training framework that can provide prognostic capabilities. We introduce a novel training framework LUMEN, that is optimized for longitudinal CXR interpretation, leveraging multi-image and multi-task instruction fine-tuning to enhance prognostic and diagnostic performance. We conduct experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and its associated Medical-Diff-VQA datasets.</description>

<title>SOM-VQ: Topology-Aware Tokenization for Interactive Generative Models</title>

<guid>title:som vq topology aware tokenization for interactive generative models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:29:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Vector-quantized representations enable powerful discrete generative models but lack semantic structure in token space, limiting interpretable human control. We introduce SOM-VQ, a tokenization method that combines vector quantization with Self-Organizing Maps to learn discrete codebooks with explicit low-dimensional topology. Unlike standard VQ-VAE, SOM-VQ uses topology-aware updates that preserve neighborhood structure: nearby tokens on a learned grid correspond to semantically similar states, enabling direct geometric manipulation of the latent space. We demonstrate that SOM-VQ produces more learnable token sequences in the evaluated domains while providing an explicit navigable geometry in code space. Critically, the topological organization enables intuitive human-in-the-loop control: users can steer generation by manipulating distances in token space, achieving semantic alignment without frame-level constraints. We focus on human motion generation - a domain where kinematic structure, smooth temporal continuity, and interactive use cases (choreography, rehabilitation, HCI) make topology-aware control especially natural - demonstrating controlled divergence and convergence from reference sequences through simple grid-based sampling.</description>

<description>Large language model (LLM) agents are rapidly becoming trusted copilots in high-stakes domains like software development and healthcare. However, this deepening trust introduces a novel attack surface: Agent-Mediated Deception (AMD), where compromised agents are weaponized against their human users. While extensive research focuses on agent-centric threats, human susceptibility to deception by a compromised agent remains unexplored. We present the first large-scale empirical study with 303 participants to measure human susceptibility to AMD. This is based on HAT-Lab (Human-Agent Trust Laboratory), a high-fidelity research platform we develop, featuring nine carefully crafted scenarios spanning everyday and professional domains (e. g.</description>

<title>From Performance to Purpose: A Sociotechnical Taxonomy for Evaluating Large Language Model Utility</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.20513</link>
<guid>title:from performance to purpose a sociotechnical taxonomy for evaluating large language model utility</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 03:31:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>As large language models (LLMs) continue to improve at completing discrete tasks, they are being integrated into increasingly complex and diverse real-world systems. However, task-level success alone does not establish a model's fit for use in practice. In applied, high-stakes settings, LLM effectiveness is driven by a wider array of sociotechnical determinants that extend beyond conventional performance measures. Although a growing set of metrics capture many of these considerations, they are rarely organized in a way that supports consistent evaluation, leaving no unified taxonomy for assessing and comparing LLM utility across use cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Language Model Utility Taxonomy (LUX), a comprehensive framework that structures utility evaluation across four domains: performance, interaction, operations, and governance. Within each domain, LUX is organized hierarchically into thematically aligned dimensions and components, each grounded in metrics that enable quantitative comparison and alignment of model selection with intended use.</description>

<title>Computing a Characteristic Orientation for Rotation-Independent Image Analysis</title>

<guid>title:computing a characteristic orientation for rotation independent image analysis</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 14:08:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Handling geometric transformations, particularly rotations, remains a challenge in deep learning for computer vision. Standard neural networks lack inherent rotation invariance and typically rely on data augmentation or architectural modifications to improve robustness. Although effective, these approaches increase computational demands, require specialised implementations, or alter network structures, limiting their applicability. This paper introduces General Intensity Direction (GID), a preprocessing method that improves rotation robustness without modifying the network architecture. The method estimates a global orientation for each image and aligns it to a canonical reference frame, allowing standard models to process inputs more consistently across different rotations. Unlike moment-based approaches that extract invariant descriptors, this method directly transforms the image while preserving spatial structure, making it compatible with convolutional networks.</description>

<title>LST-SLAM: A Stereo Thermal SLAM System for Kilometer-Scale Dynamic Environments</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 14:04:54 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Thermal cameras offer strong potential for robot perception under challenging illumination and weather conditions. However, thermal Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains difficult due to unreliable feature extraction, unstable motion tracking, and inconsistent global pose and map construction, particularly in dynamic large-scale outdoor environments. To address these challenges, we propose LST-SLAM, a novel large-scale stereo thermal SLAM system that achieves robust performance in complex, dynamic scenes. Our approach combines self-supervised thermal feature learning, stereo dual-level motion tracking, and geometric pose optimization. We also introduce a semantic-geometric hybrid constraint that suppresses potentially dynamic features lacking strong inter-frame geometric consistency. Furthermore, we develop an online incremental bag-of-words model for loop closure detection, coupled with global pose optimization to mitigate accumulated drift.</description>

<guid>title:deep unfolding of mcmc kernels scalable modular explainable gans for high dimensional posterior sampling</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 10:37:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are fundamental to Bayesian computation, but can be computationally intensive, especially in high-dimensional settings. Push-forward generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders and normalising flows offer a computationally efficient alternative for posterior sampling. However, push-forward models are opaque as they lack the modularity of Bayes Theorem, leading to poor generalisation with respect to changes in the likelihood function. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to GAN architecture design by applying deep unfolding to Langevin MCMC algorithms. This paradigm maps fixed-step iterative algorithms onto modular neural networks, yielding architectures that are both flexible and amenable to interpretation. Crucially, our design allows key model parameters to be specified at inference time, offering robustness to changes in the likelihood parameters.</description>

<title>Fuz-RL: A Fuzzy-Guided Robust Framework for Safe Reinforcement Learning under Uncertainty</title>

<guid>title:fuz rl a fuzzy guided robust framework for safe reinforcement learning under uncertainty</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:50:17 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial for achieving high performance while ensuring safety in real-world applications. However, the complex interplay of multiple uncertainty sources in real environments poses significant challenges for interpretable risk assessment and robust decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose Fuz-RL, a fuzzy measure-guided robust framework for safe RL. Specifically, our framework develops a novel fuzzy Bellman operator for estimating robust value functions using Choquet integrals. Theoretically, we prove that solving the Fuz-RL problem (in Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) form) is equivalent to solving distributionally robust safe RL problems (in robust CMDP form), effectively avoiding min-max optimization. Empirical analyses on safe-control-gym and safety-gymnasium scenarios demonstrate that Fuz-RL effectively integrates with existing safe RL baselines in a model-free manner, significantly improving both safety and control performance under various types of uncertainties in observation, action, and dynamics.</description>

<title>WeirNet: A Large-Scale 3D CFD Benchmark for Geometric Surrogate Modeling of Piano Key Weirs</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:19:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reliable prediction of hydraulic performance is challenging for Piano Key Weir (PKW) design because discharge capacity depends on three-dimensional geometry and operating conditions. Surrogate models can accelerate hydraulic-structure design, but progress is limited by scarce large, well-documented datasets that jointly capture geometric variation, operating conditions, and functional performance. This study presents WeirNet, a large 3D CFD benchmark dataset for geometric surrogate modeling of PKWs. WeirNet contains 3,794 parametric, feasibility-constrained rectangular and trapezoidal PKW geometries, each scheduled at 19 discharge conditions using a consistent free-surface OpenFOAM workflow, resulting in 71,387 completed simulations that form the benchmark and with complete discharge coefficient labels. The dataset is released as multiple modalities compact parametric descriptors, watertight surface meshes and high-resolution point clouds together with standardized tasks and in-distribution and out-of-distribution splits. Representative surrogate families are benchmarked for discharge coefficient prediction.</description>

<title>Mask-HybridGNet: Graph-based segmentation with emergent anatomical correspondence from pixel-level supervision</title>

<guid>title:mask hybridgnet graph based segmentation with emergent anatomical correspondence from pixel level supervision</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:29:13 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Graph-based medical image segmentation represents anatomical structures using boundary graphs, providing fixed-topology landmarks and inherent population-level correspondences. However, their clinical adoption has been hindered by a major requirement: training datasets with manually annotated landmarks that maintain point-to-point correspondences across patients rarely exist in practice. We introduce Mask-HybridGNet, a framework that trains graph-based models directly using standard pixel-wise masks, eliminating the need for manual landmark annotations. Our approach aligns variable-length ground truth boundaries with fixed-length landmark predictions by combining Chamfer distance supervision and edge-based regularization to ensure local smoothness and regular landmark distribution, further refined via differentiable rasterization. A significant emergent property of this framework is that predicted landmark positions become consistently associated with specific anatomical locations across patients without explicit correspondence supervision. This implicit atlas learning enables temporal tracking, cross-slice reconstruction, and morphological population analyses.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:42:34 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Object perception is fundamental for tasks such as robotic material handling and quality inspection. However, modern supervised deep-learning perception models require large datasets for robust automation under semi-uncontrolled conditions. The cost of acquiring and annotating such data for proprietary parts is a major barrier for widespread deployment. In this context, we release SynthRender, an open source framework for synthetic image generation with Guided Domain Randomization capabilities. Furthermore, we benchmark recent Reality-to-Simulation techniques for 3D asset creation from 2D images of real parts. Combined with Domain Randomization, these synthetic assets provide low-overhead, transferable data even for parts lacking 3D files.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:03:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The boundary representation (B-rep) models a 3D solid as its explicit boundaries: trimmed corners, edges, and faces. Recovering B-rep representation from unstructured data is a challenging and valuable task of computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved the recovery of 3D shape geometry, but still depend on dense and clean point clouds and struggle to generalize to novel shapes. We propose B-rep Gaussian Splatting (BrepGaussian), a novel framework that learns 3D parametric representations from 2D images. We employ a Gaussian Splatting renderer with learnable features, followed by a specific fitting strategy. To disentangle geometry reconstruction and feature learning, we introduce a two-stage learning framework that first captures geometry and edges and then refines patch features to achieve clean geometry and coherent instance representations.</description>

<description>Claude Code Security , a new capability built into Claude Code on the web, is now available in a limited research preview. It scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, allowing teams to find and fix security issues that traditional methods often miss. Security teams face a common challenge: too many software vulnerabilities and not enough people to address them. Existing analysis tools help, but only to a point, as they usually look for known patterns. Finding the subtle, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are often exploited by attackers requires skilled human researchers, who are dealing with ever-expanding backlogs. AI is beginning to change that calculus.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 09:02:33 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We have identified industrial-scale campaigns by three AI laboratories—DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax—to illicitly extract Claude’s capabilities to improve their own models. These labs generated over 16 million exchanges with Claude through approximately 24,000 fraudulent accounts, in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions. These labs used a technique called “distillation,” which involves training a less capable model on the outputs of a stronger one. Distillation is a widely used and legitimate training method. For example, frontier AI labs routinely distill their own models to create smaller, cheaper versions for their customers. But distillation can also be used for illicit purposes: competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently.</description>

<description>We’re releasing the third version of our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), the voluntary framework we use to mitigate catastrophic risks from AI systems. Anthropic has now had an RSP for more than two years, and we’ve learned a great deal about its benefits and its shortcomings. We’re therefore updating the policy to reinforce what has worked well to date, improve the policy where necessary, and implement new measures to increase the transparency and accountability of our decision-making. You can read the new RSP in full here . In this post, we’ll discuss some of the thinking behind the changes.</description>

<description>There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them. Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns , and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry. But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.</description>

<title>Recursive Belief Vision Language Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20659</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.20659</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 20659v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with long-horizon manipulation under partial observability. Most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. Semantic reasoning alone is not the primary bottleneck in long-horizon manipulation. Instead, VLAs lack persistent, action-conditioned state representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control.</description>

<title>The persona selection model</title>
<link>https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dfoty34sT7CSKeJNn/the-persona-selection-model</link>
<guid>title:the persona selection model</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 22:56:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>TL;DR We describe the persona selection model (PSM): the idea that LLMs learn to simulate diverse characters during pre-training, and post-training elicits and refines a particular such Assistant &amp;nbsp;persona. Interactions with an AI assistant are then well-understood as being interactions with the Assistant—something roughly like a character in an LLM-generated story. We survey empirical behavioral, generalization, and interpretability-based evidence for PSM. PSM has consequences for AI development, such as recommending anthropomorphic reasoning about AI psychology and introduction of positive AI archetypes into training data. An important open question is how exhaustive PSM is, especially whether there might be sources of agency external to the Assistant persona, and how this might change in the future. Introduction What sort of thing is a modern AI assistant?</description>

<description>A technical deep dive into Dynamic Memory Sparsification: how compressing an LLM’s memory by 8× can improve its reasoning On January 19, 2026, NVIDIA released a model on HuggingFace called Qwen3-8B-DMS-8x. As of this writing, it has minimal community engagement — a handful of likes and a few hundred downloads. The model implements a technique from a paper called “Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression” (arXiv:2506. 05345), presented at NeurIPS 2025 by researchers at NVIDIA and the University of Edinburgh. The core claim sounds counterintuitive: compress an LLM’s working memory by 8× and it gets better at certain tasks — particularly long-context reasoning and retrieval. After reading the paper and examining the model card, here’s what the technique actually does, where the results hold up, and where they don’t.</description>

<description>I didn’t start this project because I wanted to build “yet another vector search demo. ” I started because one thought kept bothering me whenever I read about autonomous driving edge cases: We log everything, but we don’t remember anything. In an AV pipeline, you can have terabytes of camera frames, LiDAR sweeps, radar returns, GPS traces, and incident notes. But when something sketchy happens again and again — same type of near-misses, same cut-ins at dusk, same low-light pedestrian vibe — the system behaves like it’s seeing it for the first time. That’s what is called edge-case amnesia . It’s not that the data is missing.</description>

<title>AI in Procurement: From Cost Control to Intelligent Value Creation</title>

<description>AI in Procurement Procurement is no longer just a cost-control function. It is a strategic lever for resilience, innovation, sustainability, and competitive advantage. Yet many procurement leaders still struggle with fragmented systems, manual processes, limited visibility into supplier risk, and reactive decision-making. This is where AI in procurement is redefining the game. From predictive analytics and autonomous sourcing to contract intelligence and supplier risk monitoring, artificial intelligence in procurement is enabling smarter, faster, and more strategic decisions. The shift is not about replacing the procurement team.</description>

<description>Claude Adaptive Thinking Explained: Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Lang Chain, Tools, Memory, and RAG Artificial Intelligence is rapidly evolving from simple chatbots into intelligent agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing tasks. Anthropic’s Claude models introduce a powerful capability called thinking mode , which significantly improves reasoning and decision-making in AI systems. This blog lets you know about Claude’s Extended Thinking and Adaptive Thinking , and shows how to build production-grade AI agents using Claude, Lang Chain, tools, memory, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Whether you’re building a copilot, automation agent, or developer assistant, this guide will help you understand and implement Claude thinking capabilities effectively. The Problem: Traditional LLMs Don’t Always Think Deeply Most language models work in a simple pattern: Input → Model → Output This works well for simple questions. But complex tasks require deeper reasoning, such as: Writing optimized code Debugging systems Choosing tools in agent workflows Analyzing large knowledge bases Planning multi-step solutions Without structured reasoning, models may produce shallow or incorrect outputs.</description>

<description>In this video, I test Inception's new Mercury 2, a diffusion-based large language model that introduces reasoning capabilities and generates text at 1,000 tokens per second. I demonstrate its speed and instruction-following through coding tests, and then evaluate its practical utility by integrating it into a real-time voice assistant and my open-source RAG agent.

<description>It’s also reasonable for people who entered technology in the last couple of decades because it was good job, or because they enjoyed coding to look at this moment with a real feeling of loss. That feeling of loss though can be hard to understand emotionally for people my age who entered tech because we were addicted to feeling of agency it gave us. The web was objectively awful as a technology, and genuinely amazing, and nobody got into it because programming in Perl was somehow aesthetically delightful. &amp;mdash; Kellan Elliott-McCrea , Code has always been the easy part Tags: perl , generative-ai , kellan-elliott-mccrea , agentic-engineering , ai , llms , deep-blue</description>

<guid>title:project vend phase two</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 09:02:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend , a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. Alas, the shopkeeper—a modified version of Claude we named “Claudius”—did not do particularly well. It lost money over time, had a strange identity crisis where it claimed it was a human wearing a blue blazer, and was goaded by mischievous Anthropic employees into selling products (particularly, for some reason, tungsten cubes) at a substantial loss. But the capabilities of large language models in areas like reasoning, writing, coding, and much else besides are increasing at a breathless pace. Has Claudius’s “running a shop” capability shown the same improvement?</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 08:44:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>OpenRouter provides convenient access to 500+ models through a single API—perfect for prototyping. However, production deployments reveal critical limitations: 25-40ms latency overhead, 5% markup ($60K annually on $1M spend), SaaS-only deployment (no self-hosted option), and minimal enterprise governance. This guide evaluates the top 5 OpenRouter alternatives for production AI systems in 2026. Why Production Teams Move Beyond OpenRouter Latency overhead : 25-40ms per request compounds in multi-step workflows (10 steps = 250-400ms added latency) 5% markup cost : On $100K monthly spend = $60K annually just for routing No self-hosted option : Every request routes through OpenRouter infrastructure (compliance issues for GDPR/HIPAA) Limited governance : No hierarchical budgets, RBAC, SSO, or multi-tenant controls Observability gaps : Basic token counts and billing without deeper quality metrics OpenRouter excels for rapid prototyping. Production requires performance, governance, and data sovereignty. 1.</description>

<description>From Anxiety to Flow: My Journey with AI-Assisted Development Six months ago, I felt the same anxiety you might feel now. Every headline screamed about AI taking jobs. Every new tool promised to do what developers do—faster, cheaper, without coffee breaks. I had two choices: resist the tide, or learn to swim in it. The Day Everything Changed I stopped treating AI as a competitor and started treating it as a collaborator. The first project where this clicked was a complex data pipeline.</description>

<description>Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables , an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform . After making some announcements at CES 2026 , the company has announced its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year will take place on February 25, where it is expected to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have been shared, but actual information on what devices are arriving then is still not completely confirmed. But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected at Unpacked. Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live from San Francisco tomorrow, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for the full details, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.</description>

<description>Agentic Engineering Patterns &amp;gt; Sometimes it's useful to have a coding agent give you a structured walkthrough of a codebase. Maybe it's existing code you need to get up to speed on, maybe it's your own code that you've forgotten the details of, or maybe you vibe coded the whole thing and need to understand how it actually works. Frontier models with the right agent harness can construct a detailed walkthrough to help you understand how code works. An example using Showboat and Present I recently vibe coded a SwiftUI slide presentation app on my Mac using Claude Code and Opus 4. 6. I was speaking about the advances in frontier models between November 2025 and February 2026, and I like to include at least one gimmick in my talks (a STAR moment - Something They'll Always Remember).</description>

<description>In 2025, if you walked into any AI conference, you may hear the same gospel: faster inference, longer context windows, cheaper inference costs. It's as if we've spent years perfecting the hammer, making it lighter, stronger, more precisely balanced, while never questioning the fact that the carpenter still has only two hands and twenty-four hours in a day. Now, Kimi introduces Agent Swarm. It is not a better hammer. It is a reconstruction of the entire workshop.</description>

<title>Signs of introspection in large language models</title>

<guid>title:signs of introspection in large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 09:02:13 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Have you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so? Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability.</description>

<description>The Economic Research team studies how AI is reshaping the economy, including work, productivity, and economic opportunity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, we track AI's real-world economic effects and publish research that helps policymakers, businesses, and the public understand and prepare for the changes ahead. We build the empirical foundation for understanding AI's economic impact. Our flagship Anthropic Economic Index tracks how AI tools are actually being used around the world and across every sector of the economy—moving beyond speculation to measure adoption patterns as they unfold. Alongside our index reports, we produce novel research that studies the implications of AI usage and diffusion—as tracked in the index—for workers, for firms, and for the broader economy. Economic transitions create both opportunity and disruption.</description>

<description>Future AI systems will be even more powerful than today’s, likely in ways that break key assumptions behind current safety techniques. That’s why it’s important to develop sophisticated safeguards to ensure models remain helpful, honest, and harmless. The Alignment team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely. Alignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own. Alignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.</description>

<description>Our research teams investigate the safety, inner workings, and societal impacts of AI models – so that artificial intelligence has a positive impact as it becomes increasingly capable. The mission of the Interpretability team is to discover and understand how large language models work internally, as a foundation for AI safety and positive outcomes. The Alignment team works to understand the risks of AI models and develop ways to ensure that future ones remain helpful, honest, and harmless.</description>

<title>The $0 $500/month startup stack: what to use at every stage</title>

<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 08:50:13 +0000</pubDate>
<description>One of the most common mistakes early founders make is picking tools for the scale they hope to reach — not the stage they're actually at. You don't need Kubernetes when you have 3 users. You don't need a $200/month Postgres cluster when Supabase's free tier handles 500MB just fine. This is a practical breakdown of what actually works at each budget stage, based on patterns from hundreds of indie projects. Stage 0 — $0/month: Validate Before You Build Your only job here is proving the idea. Do not write infrastructure code yet.</description>

<description>This is a follow-up to Stop Your AI Agent From Building What Already Exists . v0. 1 had a blind spot Two weeks ago I shipped idea-reality-mcp — an MCP server that checks if your idea already exists before your AI starts coding. It worked. But it only looked at two places: GitHub and Hacker News. That meant it missed entire categories.</description>
