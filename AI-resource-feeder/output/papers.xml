<title>MVISTA-4D: View-Consistent 4D World Model with Test-Time Action Inference for Robotic Manipulation</title>

<description>World-model-based imagine-then-act becomes a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, yet existing approaches typically support either purely image-based forecasting or reasoning over partial 3D geometry, limiting their ability to predict complete 4D scene dynamics. This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.</description>

<guid>title:delving into spectral clustering with vision language representations</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 09:36:24 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Spectral clustering is known as a powerful technique in unsupervised data analysis. The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i. e.</description>

<title>Where-to-Unmask: Ground-Truth-Guided Unmasking Order Learning for Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>

<guid>title:where to unmask ground truth guided unmasking order learning for masked diffusion language models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 07:56:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) generate text by iteratively filling masked tokens, requiring two coupled decisions at each step: which positions to unmask (where-to-unmask) and which tokens to place (what-to-unmask). While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts.</description>

<title>P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09443</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.09443</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 09443v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The transition from symbolic manipulation to science-grade reasoning represents a pivotal frontier for Large Language Models (LLMs), with physics serving as the critical test anchor for binding abstract logic to physical reality. Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference.</description>

<title>Causality in Video Diffusers is Separable from Denoising</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.10095</link>
<guid>title:causality in video diffusers is separable from denoising</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:57:21 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Causality -- referring to temporal, uni-directional cause-effect relationships between components -- underlies many complex generative processes, including videos, language, and robot trajectories. Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.</description>

<guid>title:tracemem weaving narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 12:14:58 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Sustaining long-term interactions remains a bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), as their limited context windows struggle to manage dialogue histories that extend over time. Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture.</description>

<title>AGMark: Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking for Large Vision-Language Models</title>

<guid>title:agmark attention guided dynamic watermarking for large vision language models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 10:02:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution.</description>

<title>Long Chain-of-Thought Compression via Fine-Grained Group Policy Optimization</title>

<guid>title:long chain of thought compression via fine grained group policy optimization</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:15:58 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate unnecessarily verbose Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning that increases computational costs and latency without proportional performance gains. In this paper, we propose \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{G}roup policy \textbf{O}ptimization (\textbf{FGO}), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that refines group responses by subdividing them and assigning appropriate weights based on length and entropy, thereby enabling effective CoT compression. Meanwhile, as an enhanced variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), FGO successfully addresses two major limitations of the GRPO: inefficient data utilization and entropy collapse. We evaluate FGO on multiple reasoning LLMs and benchmarks, including MATH500, AIME24, AMC23, and Minerva. Experimental results show that FGO achieves efficient CoT compression without degrading performance, and simultaneously resolves the key limitations of GRPO.</description>

<description>Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs.</description>

<guid>title:text summarization via global structure awareness</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 14:29:54 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Text summarization is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), and the information explosion has made long-document processing increasingly demanding, making summarization essential. Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization.</description>

<title>UniARM: Towards a Unified Autoregressive Reward Model for Multi-Objective Test-Time Alignment</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.09538</link>
<guid>title:uniarm towards a unified autoregressive reward model for multi objective test time alignment</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:49:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multi-objective alignment aims to align LLM responses with multiple human preference objectives. Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \&amp; Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:56:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Language models have become practical tools for quantum computing education and research, from summarizing technical papers to explaining theoretical concepts and answering questions about recent developments in the field. While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%.</description>

<guid>title:code sharp continuous open ended discovery and evolution of skills as hierarchical reward programs</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:51:39 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment.</description>

<description>Manufacturing lines, service journeys, supply chains, and AI reasoning chains share a common challenge: attributing a terminal outcome to the intermediate stage that caused it. We establish an information-theoretic barrier to this credit assignment problem: the signal connecting early steps to final outcomes decays exponentially with depth, creating a critical horizon beyond which no algorithm can learn from endpoint data alone. We prove four results. First, a Signal Decay Bound: sample complexity for attributing outcomes to early stages grows exponentially in the number of intervening steps. Second, Width Limits: parallel rollouts provide only logarithmic relief, with correlation capping the effective number of independent samples. Third, an Objective Mismatch: additive reward aggregation optimizes the wrong quantity when sequential validity requires all steps to be correct.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:16:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Generative AI systems are increasingly embedded in everyday life, yet empirical understanding of how psychological risk associated with AI use emerges, is experienced, and is regulated by users remains limited. We present a large-scale computational thematic analysis of posts collected between 2023 and 2025 from two Reddit communities, r/AIDangers and r/ChatbotAddiction, explicitly focused on AI-related harm and distress. Using a multi-agent, LLM-assisted thematic analysis grounded in Braun and Clarke's reflexive framework, we identify 14 recurring thematic categories and synthesize them into five higher-order experiential dimensions. To further characterize affective patterns, we apply emotion labeling using a BERT-based classifier and visualize emotional profiles across dimensions. Our findings reveal five empirically derived experiential dimensions of AI-related psychological risk grounded in real-world user discourse, with self-regulation difficulties emerging as the most prevalent and fear concentrated in concerns related to autonomy, control, and technical risk. These results provide early empirical evidence from lived user experience of how AI safety is perceived and emotionally experienced outside laboratory or speculative contexts, offering a foundation for future AI safety research, evaluation, and responsible governance.</description>

<guid>title:explainability in generative medical diffusion models a faithfulness based analysis on mri synthesis</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:41:48 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This study investigates the explainability of generative diffusion models in the context of medical imaging, focusing on Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis. Although diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating realistic medical images, their internal decision making process remains largely opaque. We present a faithfulness-based explainability framework that analyzes how prototype-based explainability methods like ProtoPNet (PPNet), Enhanced ProtoPNet (EPPNet), and ProtoPool can link the relationship between generated and training features. Our study focuses on understanding the reasoning behind image formation through denoising trajectory of diffusion model and subsequently prototype explainability with faithfulness analysis. Experimental analysis shows that EPPNet achieves the highest faithfulness (with score 0. 1534), offering more reliable insights, and explainability into the generative process.</description>

<guid>title:gafr net a graph attention and fuzzy rule network for interpretable breast cancer image classification</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 01:25:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Accurate classification of breast cancer histopathology images is pivotal for early oncological diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. However, conventional deep learning architectures often encounter performance degradation under limited annotations and suffer from a &quot;blackbox&quot; nature, hindering their clinical integration. To mitigate these limitations, we propose GAFRNet, a robust and interpretable Graph Attention and FuzzyRule Network specifically engineered for histopathology image classification with scarce supervision. GAFRNet constructs a similarity-driven graph representation to model intersample relationships and employs a multihead graph attention mechanism to capture complex relational features across heterogeneous tissue structures. Concurrently, a differentiable fuzzy-rule module encodes intrinsic topological descriptorsincluding node degree, clustering coefficient, and label consistencyinto explicit, human-understandable diagnostic logic. This design establishes transparent &quot;IF-THEN&quot; mappings that mimic the heuristic deduction process of medical experts, providing clear reasoning behind each prediction without relying on post-hoc attribution methods.</description>

<guid>title:stroke3d lifting 2d strokes into rigged 3d model via latent diffusion models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 12:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Rigged 3D assets are fundamental to 3D deformation and animation. However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL.</description>

<title>Physics-informed diffusion models in spectral space</title>

<guid>title:physics informed diffusion models in spectral space</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 12:11:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We propose a methodology that combines generative latent diffusion models with physics-informed machine learning to generate solutions of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) conditioned on partial observations, which includes, in particular, forward and inverse PDE problems. We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

<guid>title:comprehensive comparison of rag methods across multi domain conversational qa</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:59:23 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Conversational question answering increasingly relies on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG.</description>

<description>The CheckThat! lab aims to advance the development of innovative technologies combating disinformation and manipulation efforts in online communication across a multitude of languages and platforms. While in early editions the focus has been on core tasks of the verification pipeline (check-worthiness, evidence retrieval, and verification), in the past three editions, the lab added additional tasks linked to the verification process. In this year's edition, the verification pipeline is at the center again with the following tasks: Task 1 on source retrieval for scientific web claims (a follow-up of the 2025 edition), Task 2 on fact-checking numerical and temporal claims, which adds a reasoning component to the 2025 edition, and Task 3, which expands the verification pipeline with generation of full-fact-checking articles. These tasks represent challenging classification and retrieval problems as well as generation challenges at the document and span level, including multilingual settings.</description>

<title>Step-resolved data attribution for looped transformers</title>

<guid>title:step resolved data attribution for looped transformers</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:57:53 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We study how individual training examples shape the internal computation of looped transformers, where a shared block is applied for $τ$ recurrent iterations to enable latent reasoning. Existing training-data influence estimators such as TracIn yield a single scalar score that aggregates over all loop iterations, obscuring when during the recurrent computation a training example matters. We introduce \textit{Step-Decomposed Influence (SDI)}, which decomposes TracIn into a length-$τ$ influence trajectory by unrolling the recurrent computation graph and attributing influence to specific loop iterations. To make SDI practical at transformer scale, we propose a TensorSketch implementation that never materialises per-example gradients. Experiments on looped GPT-style models and algorithmic reasoning tasks show that SDI scales excellently, matches full-gradient baselines with low error and supports a broad range of data attribution and interpretability tasks with per-step insights into the latent reasoning process.</description>

<title>Kunlun: Establishing Scaling Laws for Massive-Scale Recommendation Systems through Unified Architecture Design</title>

<guid>title:kunlun establishing scaling laws for massive scale recommendation systems through unified architecture design</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 17:37:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Deriving predictable scaling laws that govern the relationship between model performance and computational investment is crucial for designing and allocating resources in massive-scale recommendation systems. While such laws are established for large language models, they remain challenging for recommendation systems, especially those processing both user history and context features. We identify poor scaling efficiency as the main barrier to predictable power-law scaling, stemming from inefficient modules with low Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and suboptimal resource allocation. We introduce Kunlun, a scalable architecture that systematically improves model efficiency and resource allocation. Our low-level optimizations include Generalized Dot-Product Attention (GDPA), Hierarchical Seed Pooling (HSP), and Sliding Window Attention. Our high-level innovations feature Computation Skip (CompSkip) and Event-level Personalization.</description>

<title>A Unified Assessment of the Poverty of the Stimulus Argument for Neural Language Models</title>

<description>How can children acquire native-level syntax from limited input? According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases.</description>

<title>The Catastrophic Failure of The k-Means Algorithm in High Dimensions, and How Hartigan's Algorithm Avoids It</title>

<description>Lloyd's k-means algorithm is one of the most widely used clustering methods. We prove that in high-dimensional, high-noise settings, the algorithm exhibits catastrophic failure: with high probability, essentially every partition of the data is a fixed point. Consequently, Lloyd's algorithm simply returns its initial partition - even when the underlying clusters are trivially recoverable by other methods. In contrast, we prove that Hartigan's k-means algorithm does not exhibit this pathology. Our results show the stark difference between these algorithms and offer a theoretical explanation for the empirical difficulties often observed with k-means in high dimensions.</description>

<title>AmharicIR+Instr: A Two-Dataset Resource for Neural Retrieval and Instruction Tuning</title>

<description>Neural retrieval and GPT-style generative models rely on large, high-quality supervised data, which is still scarce for low-resource languages such as Amharic. We release an Amharic data resource consisting of two datasets that supports research on (i) neural retrieval-ranking and (ii) instruction-following text generation. The retrieval-ranking dataset contains 1,091 manually verified query-positive-negative document triplets drawn from diverse Amharic sources and constructed to support contrastive training and benchmarking of neural retrievers (e. g. , DPR, ColBERT-style late interaction and SPLADE-style sparse neural retrieval). Triplets are created through a combination of expert-curated queries, web-derived queries, and LLM-assisted generation, with positive/negative documents selected from the web or synthesized by LLMs and then validated by native speakers.</description>

<title>From FusHa to Folk: Exploring Cross-Lingual Transfer in Arabic Language Models</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.09826</link>
<guid>title:from fusha to folk exploring cross lingual transfer in arabic language models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 14:34:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Arabic Language Models (LMs) are pretrained predominately on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and are expected to transfer to its dialects. While MSA as the standard written variety is commonly used in formal settings, people speak and write online in various dialects that are spread across the Arab region. This poses limitations for Arabic LMs, since its dialects vary in their similarity to MSA. In this work we study cross-lingual transfer of Arabic models using probing on 3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks, and representational similarity. Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects.</description>

<title>Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish: Evidence from Lexical Variation in LLMs</title>

<guid>title:digital linguistic bias in spanish evidence from lexical variation in llms</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:42:22 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This study examines the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) capture geographic lexical variation in Spanish, a language that exhibits substantial regional variation. Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico &amp; Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish.</description>

<title>Symbolic Pattern Temporal Numeric Planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.09798</link>
<guid>title:symbolic pattern temporal numeric planning with intermediate conditions and effects</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 14:03:40 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Recently, a Symbolic Pattern Planning (SPP) approach was proposed for numeric planning where a pattern (i. e. , a finite sequence of actions) suggests a causal order between actions. The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans. If the suggestion by the pattern is inaccurate and no valid plan can be found, the pattern is extended until it contains the causal order of actions in a valid plan, making the approach complete. In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution.</description>

<title>Don't Shoot The Breeze: Topic Continuity Model Using Nonlinear Naive Bayes With Attention</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 01:05:31 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) as chatbots in diverse business scenarios often presents the challenge of maintaining topic continuity. Abrupt shifts in topics can lead to poor user experiences and inefficient utilization of computational resources. In this paper, we present a topic continuity model aimed at assessing whether a response aligns with the initial conversation topic. Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula.</description>
