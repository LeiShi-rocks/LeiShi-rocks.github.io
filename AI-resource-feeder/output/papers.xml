<title>1-Bit Wonder: Improving QAT Performance in the Low-Bit Regime through K-Means Quantization</title>

<guid>title:1 bit wonder improving qat performance in the low bit regime through k means quantization</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 13:23:26 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Quantization-aware training (QAT) is an effective method to drastically reduce the memory footprint of LLMs while keeping performance degradation at an acceptable level. However, the optimal choice of quantization format and bit-width presents a challenge in practice. The full design space of quantization is not fully explored in the context of QAT, and the precise trade-off between quantization and downstream performance is poorly understood, as comparisons often rely solely on perplexity-based evaluations. In this work, we address these shortcomings with an empirical study of QAT in the low-bit regime. We show that k-means based weight quantization outperforms integer formats and can be implemented efficiently on standard hardware. Furthermore, we find that, under a fixed inference memory budget, the best performance on generative downstream tasks is achieved with $1$-bit quantized weights.</description>

<title>Perceptive Humanoid Parkour: Chaining Dynamic Human Skills via Motion Matching</title>

<guid>title:perceptive humanoid parkour chaining dynamic human skills via motion matching</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:59:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>While recent advances in humanoid locomotion have achieved stable walking on varied terrains, capturing the agility and adaptivity of highly dynamic human motions remains an open challenge. In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL.</description>

<description>A growing literature uses large language models (LLMs) as synthetic participants to generate cost-effective and nearly instantaneous responses in social science experiments. However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses.</description>

<title>Improving MLLMs in Embodied Exploration and Question Answering with Human-Inspired Memory Modeling</title>

<description>arXiv:2602. 15513v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Deploying Multimodal Large Language Models as the brain of embodied agents remains challenging, particularly under long-horizon observations and limited context budgets. Existing memory assisted methods often rely on textual summaries, which discard rich visual and spatial details and remain brittle in non-stationary environments. In this work, we propose a non-parametric memory framework that explicitly disentangles episodic and semantic memory for embodied exploration and question answering. Our retrieval-first, reasoning-assisted paradigm recalls episodic experiences via semantic similarity and verifies them through visual reasoning, enabling robust reuse of past observations without rigid geometric alignment. In parallel, we introduce a program-style rule extraction mechanism that converts experiences into structured, reusable semantic memory, facilitating cross-environment generalization.</description>

<title>PERSONA: Dynamic and Compositional Inference-Time Personality Control via Activation Vector Algebra</title>

<guid>title:persona dynamic and compositional inference time personality control via activation vector algebra</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 15:47:58 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Current methods for personality control in Large Language Models rely on static prompting or expensive fine-tuning, failing to capture the dynamic and compositional nature of human traits. We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9. 60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.</description>

<title>STAPO: Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning for LLMs by Silencing Rare Spurious Tokens</title>

<guid>title:stapo stabilizing reinforcement learning for llms by silencing rare spurious tokens</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 14:46:48 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has significantly improved large language model reasoning, but existing RL fine-tuning methods rely heavily on heuristic techniques such as entropy regularization and reweighting to maintain stability. In practice, they often experience late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. We derive that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. Building on this result, we prove that training instability is driven by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0. 01\%, which we term \emph{spurious tokens}. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates.</description>

<title>The geometry of online conversations and the causal antecedents of conflictual discourse</title>

<guid>title:the geometry of online conversations and the causal antecedents of conflictual discourse</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 14:12:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This article investigates the causal antecedents of conflictual language and the geometry of interaction in online threaded conversations related to climate change. We employ three annotation dimensions, inferred through LLM prompting and averaging, to capture complementary aspects of discursive conflict (such as stance: agreement vs disagreement; tone: attacking vs respectful; and emotional versus factual framing) and use data from a threaded online forum to examine how these dimensions respond to temporal, conversational, and arborescent structural features of discussions. We show that, as suggested by the literature, longer delays between successive posts in a thread are associated with replies that are, on average, more respectful, whereas longer delays relative to the parent post are associated with slightly less disagreement but more emotional (less factual) language. Second, we characterize alignment with the local conversational environment and find strong convergence both toward the average stance, tone and emotional framing of older sibling posts replying to the same parent and toward those of the parent post itself, with parent post effects generally stronger than sibling effects. We further show that early branch-level responses condition these alignment dynamics, such that parent-child stance alignment is amplified or attenuated depending on whether a branch is initiated in agreement or disagreement with the discussion's root message. These influences are largely additive for civility-related dimensions (attacking vs respectful, disagree vs agree), whereas for emotional versus factual framing there is a significant interaction: alignment with the parent's emotionality is amplified when older siblings are similarly aligned.</description>

<guid>title:llm as judge on a budget</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 10:35:41 +0000</pubDate>
<description>LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as a cornerstone technique for evaluating large language models by leveraging LLM reasoning to score prompt-response pairs. Since LLM judgments are stochastic, practitioners commonly query each pair multiple times to estimate mean scores accurately. This raises a critical challenge: given a fixed computational budget $B$, how to optimally allocate queries across $K$ prompt-response pairs to minimize estimation error? % We present a principled variance-adaptive approach leveraging multi-armed bandit theory and concentration inequalities. Our method dynamically allocates queries based on estimated score variances, concentrating resources where uncertainty is highest. Further, our algorithm is shown to achieve a worst-case score-estimation error of $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^K σ_i^2}{B}}\right)$, $σ_i^2$ being the unknown score variance for pair $i \in [K]$ with near-optimal budget allocation.</description>

<guid>title:gaiaflow semantic guided diffusion tuning for carbon frugal search</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 08:35:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>As the burgeoning power requirements of sophisticated neural architectures escalate, the information retrieval community has recognized ecological sustainability as a pivotal priority that necessitates a fundamental paradigm shift in model design. While contemporary neural rankers have attained unprecedented accuracy, the substantial environmental externalities associated with their computational intensity often remain overlooked in large-scale deployments. We present GaiaFlow, an innovative framework engineered to facilitate carbon-frugal search by operationalizing semantic-guided diffusion tuning. Our methodology orchestrates the convergence of retrieval-guided Langevin dynamics and a hardware-independent performance modeling strategy to optimize the trade-off between search precision and environmental preservation. By incorporating adaptive early exit protocols and precision-aware quantized inference, the proposed architecture significantly mitigates operational carbon footprints while maintaining robust retrieval quality across heterogeneous computing infrastructures. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that GaiaFlow achieves a superior equilibrium between effectiveness and energy efficiency, offering a scalable and sustainable pathway for next-generation neural search systems.</description>

<title>The Geometry of Alignment Collapse: When Fine-Tuning Breaks Safety</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.15799</link>
<guid>title:the geometry of alignment collapse when fine tuning breaks safety</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:39:15 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Fine-tuning aligned language models on benign tasks unpredictably degrades safety guardrails, even when training data contains no harmful content and developers have no adversarial intent. We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is structurally unstable and collapses under the dynamics of gradient descent. We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters.</description>

<description>Evaluating the quality of automatically generated text often relies on LLM-as-a-judge (LLM-judge) methods. While effective, these approaches are computationally expensive and require post-processing. To address these limitations, we build upon ParaPLUIE, a perplexity-based LLM-judge metric that estimates confidence over ``Yes/No'' answers without generating text. We introduce *-PLUIE, task specific prompting variants of ParaPLUIE and evaluate their alignment with human judgement. Our experiments show that personalised *-PLUIE achieves stronger correlations with human ratings while maintaining low computational cost.</description>

<description>Multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) are often used to answer questions in structured data such as tables in Markdown, JSON, and images. While these models can often give correct answers, users also need to know where those answers come from. In this work, we study structured data attribution/citation, which is the ability of the models to point to the specific rows and columns that support an answer. We evaluate several mLLMs across different table formats and prompting strategies. Our results show a clear gap between question answering and evidence attribution. Although question answering accuracy remains moderate, attribution accuracy is much lower, near random for JSON inputs, across all models.</description>

<title>Beyond Binary Classification: Detecting Fine-Grained Sexism in Social Media Videos</title>

<guid>title:beyond binary classification detecting fine grained sexism in social media videos</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 17:45:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Online sexism appears in various forms, which makes its detection challenging. Although automated tools can enhance the identification of sexist content, they are often restricted to binary classification. Consequently, more subtle manifestations of sexism may remain undetected due to the lack of fine-grained, context-sensitive labels. To address this issue, we make the following contributions: (1) we present FineMuSe, a new multimodal sexism detection dataset in Spanish that includes both binary and fine-grained annotations; (2) we introduce a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy that encompasses forms of sexism, non-sexism, and rhetorical devices of irony and humor; and (3) we evaluate a wide range of LLMs for both binary and fine-grained sexism detection. Our findings indicate that multimodal LLMs perform competitively with human annotators in identifying nuanced forms of sexism; however, they struggle to capture co-occurring sexist types when these are conveyed through visual cues.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Assessing human muscle fatigue is critical for optimizing performance and safety in physical human-robot interaction(pHRI). This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:00:08 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Neural networks can accurately forecast complex dynamical systems, yet how they internally represent underlying latent geometry remains poorly understood. We study neural forecasters through the lens of representational alignment, introducing anchor-based, geometry-agnostic relative embeddings that remove rotational and scaling ambiguities in latent spaces. Applying this framework across seven canonical dynamical systems - ranging from periodic to chaotic - we reveal reproducible family-level structure: multilayer perceptrons align with other MLPs, recurrent networks with RNNs, while transformers and echo-state networks achieve strong forecasts despite weaker alignment. Alignment generally correlates with forecasting accuracy, yet high accuracy can coexist with low alignment. Relative geometry thus provides a simple, reproducible foundation for comparing how model families internalize and represent dynamical structure.</description>

<description>Understanding how language models carry out long-horizon reasoning remains an open challenge. Existing interpretability methods often highlight tokens or spans correlated with an answer, but they rarely reveal where the model makes consequential reasoning turns, which earlier context causally triggers those turns, or whether the highlighted text actually steers the reasoning process. We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score. We also compute turning-angle curvature changes on raw logits as a complementary diagnostic and introduce curvature signatures to summarize shared intervention-response geometry.</description>

<description>The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background).</description>

<guid>title:quantifying construct validity in large language model evaluations</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 12:15:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The LLM community often reports benchmark results as if they are synonymous with general model capabilities. However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance. Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity.</description>

<description>Fair scores reward ensemble forecast members that behave like samples from the same distribution as the verifying observations. They are therefore an attractive choice as loss functions to train data-driven ensemble forecasts or post-processing methods when large training ensembles are either unavailable or computationally prohibitive. The adjusted continuous ranked probability score (aCRPS) is fair and unbiased with respect to ensemble size, provided forecast members are exchangeable and interpretable as conditionally independent draws from an underlying predictive distribution. However, distribution-aware post-processing methods that introduce structural dependency between members can violate this assumption, rendering aCRPS unfair. We demonstrate this effect using two approaches designed to minimize the expected aCRPS of a finite ensemble: (1) a linear member-by-member calibration, which couples members through a common dependency on the sample ensemble mean, and (2) a deep-learning method, which couples members via transformer self-attention across the ensemble dimension. In both cases, the results are sensitive to ensemble size and apparent gains in aCRPS can correspond to systematic unreliability characterized by over-dispersion.</description>

<title>Neural Scaling Laws for Boosted Jet Tagging</title>

<guid>title:neural scaling laws for boosted jet tagging</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:13:01 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established that scaling compute, through joint increases in model capacity and dataset size, is the primary driver of performance in modern machine learning. While machine learning has long been an integral component of High Energy Physics (HEP) data analysis workflows, the compute used to train state-of-the-art HEP models remains orders of magnitude below that of industry foundation models. With scaling laws only beginning to be studied in the field, we investigate neural scaling laws for boosted jet classification using the public JetClass dataset. We derive compute optimal scaling laws and identify an effective performance limit that can be consistently approached through increased compute. We study how data repetition, common in HEP where simulation is expensive, modifies the scaling yielding a quantifiable effective dataset size gain. We then study how the scaling coefficients and asymptotic performance limits vary with the choice of input features and particle multiplicity, demonstrating that increased compute reliably drives performance toward an asymptotic limit, and that more expressive, lower-level features can raise the performance limit and improve results at fixed dataset size.</description>

<description>Low-resource languages pose persistent challenges for Natural Language Processing tasks such as lemmatization and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. This paper investigates the capacity of recent large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 variants and open-weight Mistral models, to address these tasks in few-shot and zero-shot settings for four historically and linguistically diverse under-resourced languages: Ancient Greek, Classical Armenian, Old Georgian, and Syriac. Using a novel benchmark comprising aligned training and out-of-domain test corpora, we evaluate the performance of foundation models across lemmatization and POS-tagging, and compare them with PIE, a task-specific RNN baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, even without fine-tuning, achieve competitive or superior performance in POS-tagging and lemmatization across most languages in few-shot settings. Significant challenges persist for languages characterized by complex morphology and non-Latin scripts, but we demonstrate that LLMs are a credible and relevant option for initiating linguistic annotation tasks in the absence of data, serving as an effective aid for annotation.</description>

<guid>title:automated multi source debugging and natural language error explanation for dashboard applications</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:06:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Modern web dashboards and enterprise applications increasingly rely on complex, distributed microservices architectures. While these architectures offer scalability, they introduce significant challenges in debugging and observability. When failures occur, they often manifest as opaque error messages to the end-user such as Something went wrong. This masks the underlying root cause which may reside in browser side exceptions, API contract violations, or server side logic failures. Existing monitoring tools capture these events in isolation but fail to correlate them effectively or provide intelligible explanations to non technical users. This paper proposes a novel system for Automated Multi Source Debugging and Natural Language Error Explanation.</description>

<description>Node embeddings map graph vertices into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces while preserving structural information. They are central to tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and signal reconstruction. A key goal is to design node embeddings whose dot products capture meaningful notions of node similarity induced by the graph. Graph kernels offer a principled way to define such similarities, but their direct computation is often prohibitive for large networks. Inspired by random feature methods for kernel approximation in Euclidean spaces, we introduce randomized spectral node embeddings whose dot products estimate a low-rank approximation of any specific graph kernel. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that our embeddings achieve more accurate kernel approximations than existing methods, particularly for spectrally localized kernels.</description>

<title>How to Disclose? Strategic AI Disclosure in Crowdfunding</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.15698</link>
<guid>title:how to disclose strategic ai disclosure in crowdfunding</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:26:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly integrates into crowdfunding practices, strategic disclosure of AI involvement has become critical. Yet, empirical insights into how different disclosure strategies influence investor decisions remain limited. Drawing on signaling theory and Aristotle's rhetorical framework, we examine how mandatory AI disclosure affects crowdfunding performance and how substantive signals (degree of AI involvement) and rhetorical signals (logos/explicitness, ethos/authenticity, pathos/emotional tone) moderate these effects. Leveraging Kickstarter's mandatory AI disclosure policy as a natural experiment and four supplementary online experiments, we find that mandatory AI disclosure significantly reduces crowdfunding performance: funds raised decline by 39. 8% and backer counts by 23. 9% for AI-involved projects.</description>

<description>Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) force rapid topology changes that can render standard operating points infeasible, requiring operators to quickly identify corrective transmission switching actions that reduce load shedding while maintaining acceptable voltage behavior. We present a verifiable, multi-stage adaptation pipeline that fine-tunes an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) to generate \emph{open-only} corrective switching plans from compact PSPS scenario summaries under an explicit switching budget. First, supervised fine-tuning distills a DC-OPF MILP oracle into a constrained action grammar that enables reliable parsing and feasibility checks. Second, direct preference optimization refines the policy using AC-evaluated preference pairs ranked by a voltage-penalty metric, injecting voltage-awareness beyond DC imitation. Finally, best-of-$N$ selection provides an inference-time addition by choosing the best feasible candidate under the target metric. On IEEE 118-bus PSPS scenarios, fine-tuning substantially improves DC objective values versus zero-shot generation, reduces AC power-flow failure from 50\% to single digits, and improves voltage-penalty outcomes on the common-success set.</description>

<description>Dog emotion recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing human-animal interactions, veterinary care, and the development of automated systems for monitoring canine well-being. However, accurately interpreting dog emotions is challenging due to the subjective nature of emotional assessments and the absence of standardized ground truth methods. We present the CREMD (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Dogs Dataset), a comprehensive dataset exploring how different presentation modes (e. g. , context, audio, video) and annotator characteristics (e. g.</description>

<title>ER-MIA: Black-Box Adversarial Memory Injection Attacks on Long-Term Memory-Augmented Large Language Models</title>

<guid>title:er mia black box adversarial memory injection attacks on long term memory augmented large language models</guid>

<description>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with long-term memory systems to overcome finite context windows and enable persistent reasoning across interactions. However, recent research finds that LLMs become more vulnerable because memory provides extra attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of black-box adversarial memory injection attacks that target the similarity-based retrieval mechanism in long-term memory-augmented LLMs. We introduce ER-MIA, a unified framework that exposes this vulnerability and formalizes two realistic attack settings: content-based attacks and question-targeted attacks. In these settings, ER-MIA includes an arsenal of composable attack primitives and ensemble attacks that achieve high success rates under minimal attacker assumptions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and long-term memory systems demonstrate that similarity-based retrieval constitutes a fundamental and system-level vulnerability, revealing security risks that persist across memory designs and application scenarios.</description>

<title>Continuous-Time Piecewise-Linear Recurrent Neural Networks</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 15:16:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we aim to recover the dynamical system (DS) underlying observed time series. Specifically, we aim to learn a generative surrogate model which approximates the underlying, data-generating DS, and recreates its long-term properties (`climate statistics'). In scientific and medical areas, in particular, these models need to be mechanistically tractable -- through their mathematical analysis we would like to obtain insight into the recovered system's workings. Piecewise-linear (PL), ReLU-based RNNs (PLRNNs) have a strong track-record in this regard, representing SOTA DSR models while allowing mathematical insight by virtue of their PL design. However, all current PLRNN variants are discrete-time maps. This is in disaccord with the assumed continuous-time nature of most physical and biological processes, and makes it hard to accommodate data arriving at irregular temporal intervals.</description>

<title>Training-Free Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection in 3D Brain MRI with 2D Foundation Models</title>

<guid>title:training free zero shot anomaly detection in 3d brain mri with 2d foundation models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 02:46:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has gained increasing attention in medical imaging as a way to identify abnormalities without task-specific supervision, but most advances remain limited to 2D datasets. Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision. Our results show that training-free, batch-based ZSAD can be effectively extended from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection.</description>

<title>Mnemis: Dual-Route Retrieval on Hierarchical Graphs for Long-Term LLM Memory</title>

<guid>title:mnemis dual route retrieval on hierarchical graphs for long term llm memory</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 02:44:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>AI Memory, specifically how models organizes and retrieves historical messages, becomes increasingly valuable to Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing methods (RAG and Graph-RAG) primarily retrieve memory through similarity-based mechanisms. While efficient, such System-1-style retrieval struggles with scenarios that require global reasoning or comprehensive coverage of all relevant information. In this work, We propose Mnemis, a novel memory framework that integrates System-1 similarity search with a complementary System-2 mechanism, termed Global Selection. Mnemis organizes memory into a base graph for similarity retrieval and a hierarchical graph that enables top-down, deliberate traversal over semantic hierarchies. By combining the complementary strength from both retrieval routes, Mnemis retrieves memory items that are both semantically and structurally relevant. Mnemis achieves state-of-the-art performance across all compared methods on long-term memory benchmarks, scoring 93.</description>
