<description>The rapid advancement of AI-powered smart glasses, one of the hottest wearable devices, has unlocked new frontiers for multimodal interaction, with Visual Question Answering (VQA) over external knowledge sources emerging as a core application. Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) adapted to smart glasses are typically trained and evaluated on traditional multimodal datasets; however, these datasets lack the variety and realism needed to reflect smart glasses usage scenarios and diverge from their specific challenges, where accurately identifying the object of interest must precede any external knowledge retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce SUPERGLASSES, the first comprehensive VQA benchmark built on real-world data entirely collected by smart glasses devices. SUPERGLASSES comprises 2,422 egocentric image-question pairs spanning 14 image domains and 8 query categories, enriched with full search trajectories and reasoning annotations. We evaluate 26 representative VLMs on this benchmark, revealing significant performance gaps. To address the limitations of existing models, we further propose SUPERLENS, a multimodal smart glasses agent that enables retrieval-augmented answer generation by integrating automatic object detection, query decoupling, and multimodal web search.</description>

<title>When to Act, Ask, or Learn: Uncertainty-Aware Policy Steering</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22474</link>
<guid>title:when to act ask or learn uncertainty aware policy steering</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 23:23:22 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Policy steering is an emerging way to adapt robot behaviors at deployment-time: a learned verifier analyzes low-level action samples proposed by a pre-trained policy (e. g. , diffusion policy) and selects only those aligned with the task. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are promising general-purpose verifiers due to their reasoning capabilities, existing frameworks often assume these models are well-calibrated. In practice, the overconfident judgment from VLM can degrade the steering performance under both high-level semantic uncertainty in task specifications and low-level action uncertainty or incapability of the pre-trained policy. We propose uncertainty-aware policy steering (UPS), a framework that jointly reasons about semantic task uncertainty and low-level action feasibility, and selects an uncertainty resolution strategy: execute a high-confidence action, clarify task ambiguity via natural language queries, or ask for action interventions to correct the low-level policy when it is deemed incapable at the task.</description>

<guid>title:instruction based image editing with planning reasoning and generation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 04:56:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Editing images via instruction provides a natural way to generate interactive content, but it is a big challenge due to the higher requirement of scene understanding and generation. Prior work utilizes a chain of large language models, object segmentation models, and editing models for this task. However, the understanding models provide only a single modality ability, restricting the editing quality. We aim to bridge understanding and generation via a new multi-modality model that provides the intelligent abilities to instruction-based image editing models for more complex cases. To achieve this goal, we individually separate the instruction editing task with the multi-modality chain of thought prompts, i. e.</description>

<title>AgentSentry: Mitigating Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents via Temporal Causal Diagnostics and Context Purification</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22724</link>
<guid>title:agentsentry mitigating indirect prompt injection in llm agents via temporal causal diagnostics and context purification</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 07:59:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools and retrieval systems to autonomously complete complex tasks. However, this design exposes agents to indirect prompt injection (IPI), where attacker-controlled context embedded in tool outputs or retrieved content silently steers agent actions away from user intent. Unlike prompt-based attacks, IPI unfolds over multi-turn trajectories, making malicious control difficult to disentangle from legitimate task execution. Existing inference-time defenses primarily rely on heuristic detection and conservative blocking of high-risk actions, which can prematurely terminate workflows or broadly suppress tool usage under ambiguous multi-turn scenarios. We propose AgentSentry, a novel inference-time detection and mitigation framework for tool-augmented LLM agents. To the best of our knowledge, AgentSentry is the first inference-time defense to model multi-turn IPI as a temporal causal takeover.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 15:27:09 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Leveraging future observation modeling to facilitate action generation presents a promising avenue for enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. However, existing approaches struggle to strike a balance between maintaining efficient, predictable future representations and preserving sufficient fine-grained information to guide precise action generation. To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities. Moreover, it learns effectively from substantial human manipulation videos.</description>

<title>RADAR: Reasoning as Discrimination with Aligned Representations for LLM-based Knowledge Graph Reasoning</title>

<guid>title:radar reasoning as discrimination with aligned representations for llm based knowledge graph reasoning</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 14:34:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) infers missing facts, with recent advances increasingly harnessing the semantic priors and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing generative paradigms are prone to memorizing surface-level co-occurrences rather than learning genuine relational semantics, limiting out-of-distribution generalization. To address this, we propose RADAR, which reformulates KGR from generative pattern matching to discriminative relational reasoning. We recast KGR as discriminative entity selection, where reinforcement learning enforces relative entity separability beyond token-likelihood imitation. Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations. Across four benchmarks, RADAR achieves 5-6% relative gains on link prediction and triple classification over strong LLM baselines, while increasing task-relevant mutual information in intermediate representations by 62.</description>

<title>CrystaL: Spontaneous Emergence of Visual Latents in MLLMs</title>

<guid>title:crystal spontaneous emergence of visual latents in mllms</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 15:01:30 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by integrating powerful language backbones with large-scale visual encoders. Among these, latent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods enable implicit reasoning in continuous hidden states, facilitating seamless vision-language integration and faster inference. However, existing heuristically predefined supervision signals in latent CoT provide limited guidance for preserving critical visual information in intermediate latent states. To address this limitation, we propose CrystaL (Crystallized Latent Reasoning), a single-stage framework with two paths to process intact and corrupted images, respectively. By explicitly aligning the attention patterns and prediction distributions across the two paths, CrystaL crystallizes latent representations into task-relevant visual semantics, without relying on auxiliary annotations or external modules. Extensive experiments on perception-intensive benchmarks demonstrate that CrystaL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving substantial gains in fine-grained visual understanding while maintaining robust reasoning capabilities.</description>

<title>Beyond Refusal: Probing the Limits of Agentic Self-Correction for Semantic Sensitive Information</title>

<guid>title:beyond refusal probing the limits of agentic self correction for semantic sensitive information</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 02:09:23 +0000</pubDate>
<description>While defenses for structured PII are mature, Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new threat: Semantic Sensitive Information (SemSI), where models infer sensitive identity attributes, generate reputation-harmful content, or hallucinate potentially wrong information. The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic &quot;Editor&quot; iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34. 6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9. 8%.</description>

<guid>title:swe prot g learning to selectively collaborate with an expert unlocks small language models as software engineering agents</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 17:11:49 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Small language models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in cost, latency, and adaptability, but have so far lagged behind larger models on long-horizon software engineering tasks such as SWE-bench, where they suffer from pervasive action looping and low resolution rates. We introduce SWE-Protégé, a post-training framework that reframes software repair as an expert-protégé collaboration problem. In SWE-Protégé, an SLM remains the sole decision-maker while learning to selectively seek guidance from a strong expert model, recognize stalled states, and follow through on expert feedback. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on expert-augmented trajectories with agentic reinforcement learning that explicitly discourages degenerative looping and unproductive expert collaboration. We lightly post-train Qwen2. 5-Coder-7B-Instruct to achieve 42.</description>

<title>Evaluating Proactive Risk Awareness of Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.20976</link>
<guid>title:evaluating proactive risk awareness of large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in everyday decision-making, their safety responsibilities extend beyond reacting to explicit harmful intent toward anticipating unintended but consequential risks. In this work, we introduce a proactive risk awareness evaluation framework that measures whether LLMs can anticipate potential harms and provide warnings before damage occurs. We construct the Butterfly dataset to instantiate this framework in the environmental and ecological domain. It contains 1,094 queries that simulate ordinary solution-seeking activities whose responses may induce latent ecological impact. Through experiments across five widely used LLMs, we analyze the effects of response length, languages, and modality. Experimental results reveal consistent, significant declines in proactive awareness under length-restricted responses, cross-lingual similarities, and persistent blind spots in (multimodal) species protection.</description>

<title>TopoEdit: Fast Post-Optimization Editing of Topology Optimized Structures</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22430</link>
<guid>title:topoedit fast post optimization editing of topology optimized structures</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 21:41:44 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Despite topology optimization producing high-performance structures, late-stage localized revisions remain brittle: direct density-space edits (e. g. , warping pixels, inserting holes, swapping infill) can sever load paths and sharply degrade compliance, while re-running optimization is slow and may drift toward a qualitatively different design. We present TopoEdit, a fast post-optimization editor that demonstrates how structured latent embeddings from a pre-trained topology foundation model (OAT) can be repurposed as an interface for physics-aware engineering edits. Given an optimized topology, TopoEdit encodes it into OAT's spatial latent, applies partial noising to preserve instance identity while increasing editability, and injects user intent through an edit-then-denoise diffusion pipeline. We instantiate three edit operators: drag-based topology warping with boundary-condition-consistent conditioning updates, shell-infill lattice replacement using a lattice-anchored reference latent with updated volume-fraction conditioning, and late-stage no-design region enforcement via masked latent overwrite followed by diffusion-based recovery.</description>

<title>MUG: Meta-path-aware Universal Heterogeneous Graph Pre-Training</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22645</link>
<guid>title:mug meta path aware universal heterogeneous graph pre training</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:52:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Universal graph pre-training has emerged as a key paradigm in graph representation learning, offering a promising way to train encoders to learn transferable representations from unlabeled graphs and to effectively generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation. This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.</description>

<title>UniVBench: Towards Unified Evaluation for Video Foundation Models</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.21835</link>
<guid>title:univbench towards unified evaluation for video foundation models</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 12:08:53 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Video foundation models aim to integrate video understanding, generation, editing, and instruction following within a single framework, making them a central direction for next-generation multimodal systems. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks.</description>

<guid>title:squint fast visual reinforcement learning for sim to real robotics</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:58:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Visual reinforcement learning is appealing for robotics but expensive -- off-policy methods are sample-efficient yet slow; on-policy methods parallelize well but waste samples. Recent work has shown that off-policy methods can train faster than on-policy methods in wall-clock time for state-based control. Extending this to vision remains challenging, where high-dimensional input images complicate training dynamics and introduce substantial storage and encoding overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Squint, a visual Soft Actor Critic method that achieves faster wall-clock training than prior visual off-policy and on-policy methods. Squint achieves this via parallel simulation, a distributional critic, resolution squinting, layer normalization, a tuned update-to-data ratio, and an optimized implementation. We evaluate on the SO-101 Task Set, a new suite of eight manipulation tasks in ManiSkill3 with heavy domain randomization, and demonstrate sim-to-real transfer to a real SO-101 robot.</description>

<title>Event-Aided Sharp Radiance Field Reconstruction for Fast-Flying Drones</title>

<guid>title:event aided sharp radiance field reconstruction for fast flying drones</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:02:56 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Fast-flying aerial robots promise rapid inspection under limited battery constraints, with direct applications in infrastructure inspection, terrain exploration, and search and rescue. However, high speeds lead to severe motion blur in images and induce significant drift and noise in pose estimates, making dense 3D reconstruction with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) particularly challenging due to their high sensitivity to such degradations. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages asynchronous event streams alongside motion-blurred frames to reconstruct high-fidelity radiance fields from agile drone flights. By embedding event-image fusion into NeRF optimization and jointly refining event-based visual-inertial odometry priors using both event and frame modalities, our method recovers sharp radiance fields and accurate camera trajectories without ground-truth supervision. We validate our approach on both synthetic data and real-world sequences captured by a fast-flying drone. Despite highly dynamic drone flights, where RGB frames are severely degraded by motion blur and pose priors become unreliable, our method reconstructs high-fidelity radiance fields and preserves fine scene details, delivering a performance gain of over 50% on real-world data compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

<guid>title:learning physical principles from interaction self evolving planning via test time memory</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 20:18:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Reliable object manipulation requires understanding physical properties that vary across objects and environments. Vision-language model (VLM) planners can reason about friction and stability in general terms; however, they often cannot predict how a specific ball will roll on a particular surface or which stone will provide a stable foundation without direct experience. We present PhysMem, a memory framework that enables VLM robot planners to learn physical principles from interaction at test time, without updating model parameters. The system records experiences, generates candidate hypotheses, and verifies them through targeted interaction before promoting validated knowledge to guide future decisions. A central design choice is verification before application: the system tests hypotheses against new observations rather than applying retrieved experience directly, reducing rigid reliance on prior experience when physical conditions change. We evaluate PhysMem on three real-world manipulation tasks and simulation benchmarks across four VLM backbones.</description>

<title>HELP: HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization for Accurate and Efficient GraphRAG</title>

<guid>title:help hypernode expansion and logical path guided evidence localization for accurate and efficient graphrag</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 14:05:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with inherent knowledge boundaries and hallucinations, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues, it frequently overlooks structural interdependencies essential for multi-hop reasoning. Graph-based RAG approaches attempt to bridge this gap, yet they typically face trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency due to challenges such as costly graph traversals and semantic noise in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we propose HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization strategies for GraphRAG (HELP), a novel framework designed to balance accuracy with practical efficiency through two core strategies: 1) HyperNode Expansion, which iteratively chains knowledge triplets into coherent reasoning paths abstracted as HyperNodes to capture complex structural dependencies and ensure retrieval accuracy; and 2) Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization, which leverages precomputed graph-text correlations to map these paths directly to the corpus for superior efficiency. HELP avoids expensive random walks and semantic distortion, preserving knowledge integrity while drastically reducing retrieval latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HELP achieves competitive performance across multiple simple and multi-hop QA benchmarks and up to a 28.</description>

<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 21:57:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Despite frequent double-blind review, systemic biases related to author demographics still disadvantage underrepresented groups. We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e. g. , race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases.</description>

<guid>title:enhancing multilingual embeddings via multi way parallel text alignment</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 03:58:24 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multilingual pretraining typically lacks explicit alignment signals, leading to suboptimal cross-lingual alignment in the representation space. In this work, we show that training standard pretrained models for cross-lingual alignment with a multi-way parallel corpus in a diverse pool of languages can substantially improve multilingual and cross-lingual representations for NLU tasks. We construct a multi-way parallel dataset using translations of English text from an off-the-shelf NMT model for a pool of six target languages and achieve strong cross-lingual alignment through contrastive learning. This leads to substantial performance gains across both seen and unseen languages for multiple tasks from the MTEB benchmark evaluated for XLM-Roberta and multilingual BERT base models. Using a multi-way parallel corpus for contrastive training yields substantial gains on bitext mining (21. 3%), semantic similarity (5.</description>

<description>Inspecting Chain-of-Thought reasoning is among the most common means of understanding why an LLM produced its output. But well-known problems with CoT faithfulness severely limit what insights can be gained from this practice. In this paper, we introduce a training method called Counterfactual Simulation Training (CST), which aims to improve CoT faithfulness by rewarding CoTs that enable a simulator to accurately predict a model's outputs over counterfactual inputs. We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST.</description>

<title>Testable Learning of General Halfspaces under Massart Noise</title>

<guid>title:testable learning of general halfspaces under massart noise</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 18:30:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We study the algorithmic task of testably learning general Massart halfspaces under the Gaussian distribution. In the testable learning setting, the aim is the design of a tester-learner pair satisfying the following properties: (1) if the tester accepts, the learner outputs a hypothesis and a certificate that it achieves near-optimal error, and (2) it is highly unlikely that the tester rejects if the data satisfies the underlying assumptions. Our main result is the first testable learning algorithm for general halfspaces with Massart noise and Gaussian marginals. The complexity of our algorithm is $d^{\mathrm{polylog}(\min\{1/γ, 1/ε\})}$, where $ε$ is the excess error and $γ$ is the bias of the target halfspace, which qualitatively matches the known quasi-polynomial Statistical Query lower bound for the non-testable setting. The analysis of our algorithm hinges on a novel sandwiching polynomial approximation to the sign function with multiplicative error that may be of broader interest.</description>

<title>iMiGUE-Speech: A Spontaneous Speech Dataset for Affective Analysis</title>

<guid>title:imigue speech a spontaneous speech dataset for affective analysis</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 00:38:19 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This work presents iMiGUE-Speech, an extension of the iMiGUE dataset that provides a spontaneous affective corpus for studying emotional and affective states. The new release focuses on speech and enriches the original dataset with additional metadata, including speech transcripts, speaker-role separation between interviewer and interviewee, and word-level forced alignments. Unlike existing emotional speech datasets that rely on acted or laboratory-elicited emotions, iMiGUE-Speech captures spontaneous affect arising naturally from real match outcomes. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset and establish initial benchmarks, we introduce two evaluation tasks for comparative assessment: speech emotion recognition and transcript-based sentiment analysis. These tasks leverage state-of-the-art pre-trained representations to assess the dataset's ability to capture spontaneous affective states from both acoustic and linguistic modalities. iMiGUE-Speech can also be synchronously paired with micro-gesture annotations from the original iMiGUE dataset, forming a uniquely multimodal resource for studying speech-gesture affective dynamics.</description>

<title>Revisiting Text Ranking in Deep Research</title>

<guid>title:revisiting text ranking in deep research</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 00:18:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Deep research has emerged as an important task that aims to address hard queries through extensive open-web exploration. To tackle it, most prior work equips large language model (LLM)-based agents with opaque web search APIs, enabling agents to iteratively issue search queries, retrieve external evidence, and reason over it. Despite search's essential role in deep research, black-box web search APIs hinder systematic analysis of search components, leaving the behaviour of established text ranking methods in deep research largely unclear. To fill this gap, we reproduce a selection of key findings and best practices for IR text ranking methods in the deep research setting. In particular, we examine their effectiveness from three perspectives: (i) retrieval units (documents vs. passages), (ii) pipeline configurations (different retrievers, re-rankers, and re-ranking depths), and (iii) query characteristics (the mismatch between agent-issued queries and the training queries of text rankers).</description>

<title>The Diffusion Duality, Chapter II: $Ψ$-Samplers and Efficient Curriculum</title>

<guid>title:the diffusion duality chapter ii samplers and efficient curriculum</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:35:22 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Uniform-state discrete diffusion models excel at few-step generation and guidance due to their ability to self-correct, making them preferred over autoregressive or Masked diffusion models in these settings. However, their sampling quality plateaus with ancestral samplers as the number of steps increases. We introduce a family of Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers for discrete diffusion that generalize prior methods and apply to arbitrary noise processes. When paired with uniform-state diffusion, our samplers outperform ancestral sampling on both language and image modeling, achieving lower generative perplexity at matched unigram entropy on OpenWebText and better FID/IS scores on CIFAR10. Crucially, unlike conventional samplers, our PC methods continue to improve with more sampling steps. Taken together, these findings call into question the assumption that Masked diffusion is the inevitable future of diffusion-based language modeling.</description>

<title>XMorph: Explainable Brain Tumor Analysis Via LLM-Assisted Hybrid Deep Intelligence</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:28:08 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Deep learning has significantly advanced automated brain tumor diagnosis, yet clinical adoption remains limited by interpretability and computational constraints. Conventional models often act as opaque ''black boxes'' and fail to quantify the complex, irregular tumor boundaries that characterize malignant growth. To address these challenges, we present XMorph, an explainable and computationally efficient framework for fine-grained classification of three prominent brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. We propose an Information-Weighted Boundary Normalization (IWBN) mechanism that emphasizes diagnostically relevant boundary regions alongside nonlinear chaotic and clinically validated features, enabling a richer morphological representation of tumor growth. A dual-channel explainable AI module combines GradCAM++ visual cues with LLM-generated textual rationales, translating model reasoning into clinically interpretable insights. The proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 96.</description>

<title>mmWave Radar Aware Dual-Conditioned GAN for Speech Reconstruction of Signals With Low SNR</title>

<guid>title:mmwave radar aware dual conditioned gan for speech reconstruction of signals with low snr</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 21:43:38 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar captures are band-limited and noisy, making for difficult reconstruction of intelligible full-bandwidth speech. In this work, we propose a two-stage speech reconstruction pipeline for mmWave using a Radar-Aware Dual-conditioned Generative Adversarial Network (RAD-GAN), which is capable of performing bandwidth extension on signals with low signal-to-noise ratios (-5 dB to -1 dB), captured through glass walls. We propose an mmWave-tailored Multi-Mel Discriminator (MMD) and a Residual Fusion Gate (RFG) to enhance the generator input to process multiple conditioning channels. The proposed two-stage pipeline involves pretraining the model on synthetically clipped clean speech and finetuning on fused mel spectrograms generated by the RFG. We empirically show that the proposed method, trained on a limited dataset, with no pre-trained modules, and no data augmentations, outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for this specific task. Audio examples of RAD-GAN are available online at https://rad-gan-demo-site.</description>

<title>Learning Recursive Multi-Scale Representations for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.21498</link>
<guid>title:learning recursive multi scale representations for irregular multivariate time series forecasting</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 02:14:42 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) are characterized by uneven intervals between consecutive timestamps, which carry sampling pattern information valuable and informative for learning temporal and variable dependencies. In addition, IMTS often exhibit diverse dependencies across multiple time scales. However, many existing multi-scale IMTS methods use resampling to obtain the coarse series, which can alter the original timestamps and disrupt the sampling pattern information. To address the challenge, we propose ReIMTS, a Recursive multi-scale modeling approach for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Instead of resampling, ReIMTS keeps timestamps unchanged and recursively splits each sample into subsamples with progressively shorter time periods. Based on the original sampling timestamps in these long-to-short subsamples, an irregularity-aware representation fusion mechanism is proposed to capture global-to-local dependencies for accurate forecasting.</description>

<title>Slice and Explain: Logic-Based Explanations for Neural Networks through Domain Slicing</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22115</link>
<guid>title:slice and explain logic based explanations for neural networks through domain slicing</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 17:01:52 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Neural networks (NNs) are pervasive across various domains but often lack interpretability. To address the growing need for explanations, logic-based approaches have been proposed to explain predictions made by NNs, offering correctness guarantees. However, scalability remains a concern in these methods. This paper proposes an approach leveraging domain slicing to facilitate explanation generation for NNs. By reducing the complexity of logical constraints through slicing, we decrease explanation time by up to 40\% less time, as indicated through comparative experiments. Our findings highlight the efficacy of domain slicing in enhancing explanation efficiency for NNs.</description>

<title>VALD: Multi-Stage Vision Attack Detection for Efficient LVLM Defense</title>

<guid>title:vald multi stage vision attack detection for efficient lvlm defense</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 07:39:43 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be vulnerable to adversarial images that subtly bias their outputs toward plausible yet incorrect responses. We introduce a general, efficient, and training-free defense that combines image transformations with agentic data consolidation to recover correct model behavior. A key component of our approach is a two-stage detection mechanism that quickly filters out the majority of clean inputs. We first assess image consistency under content-preserving transformations at negligible computational cost. For more challenging cases, we examine discrepancies in a text-embedding space. Only when necessary do we invoke a powerful LLM to resolve attack-induced divergences.</description>

<title>Multi-Level Causal Embeddings</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.22287</link>
<guid>title:multi level causal embeddings</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 14:14:13 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Abstractions of causal models allow for the coarsening of models such that relations of cause and effect are preserved. Whereas abstractions focus on the relation between two models, in this paper we study a framework for causal embeddings which enable multiple detailed models to be mapped into sub-systems of a coarser causal model. We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency. By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations.</description>
