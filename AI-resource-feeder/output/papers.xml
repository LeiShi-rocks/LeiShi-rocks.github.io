<guid>title:price of universality in vector quantization is at most 0 11 bit</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:46:53 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Fast computation of a matrix product $W^\top X$ is a workhorse of modern LLMs. To make their deployment more efficient, a popular approach is that of using a low-precision approximation $\widehat W$ in place of true $W$ (&quot;weight-only quantization''). Information theory demonstrates that an optimal algorithm for reducing precision of $W$ depends on the (second order) statistics of $X$ and requires a careful alignment of vector quantization codebook with PCA directions of $X$ (a process known as &quot;waterfilling allocation''). Dependence of the codebook on statistics of $X$, however, is highly impractical. This paper proves that there exist a universal codebook that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible statistics of $X$, in the sense of being at least as good as an $X$-adapted waterfilling codebook with rate reduced by 0. 11 bit per dimension.</description>

<title>MedSAM-Agent: Empowering Interactive Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-turn Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 09:47:49 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Medical image segmentation is evolving from task-specific models toward generalizable frameworks. Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency.</description>

<title>Tempora: Characterising the Time-Contingent Utility of Online Test-Time Adaptation</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.06136</link>
<guid>title:tempora characterising the time contingent utility of online test time adaptation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:10:53 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a compelling remedy for machine learning (ML) models that degrade under domain shifts, improving generalisation on-the-fly with only unlabelled samples. This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments.</description>

<title>UNeMo: Collaborative Visual-Language Reasoning and Navigation via a Multimodal World Model</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2511. 18845v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to autonomously navigate complex environments via visual images and natural language instructions--remains highly challenging. Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making.</description>

<title>TRE: Encouraging Exploration in the Trust Region</title>

<guid>title:tre encouraging exploration in the trust region</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:21:49 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Entropy regularization is a standard technique in reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration, yet it yields negligible effects or even degrades performance in Large Language Models (LLMs). We attribute this failure to the cumulative tail risk inherent to LLMs with massive vocabularies and long generation horizons. In such environments, standard global entropy maximization indiscriminately dilutes probability mass into the vast tail of invalid tokens rather than focusing on plausible candidates, thereby disrupting coherent reasoning. To address this, we propose Trust Region Entropy (TRE), a method that encourages exploration strictly within the model's trust region. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning (MATH), combinatorial search (Countdown), and preference alignment (HH) tasks demonstrate that TRE consistently outperforms vanilla PPO, standard entropy regularization, and other exploration baselines. Our code is available at https://github.</description>

<title>PnP-U3D: Plug-and-Play 3D Framework Bridging Autoregression and Diffusion for Unified Understanding and Generation</title>

<guid>title:pnp u3d plug and play 3d framework bridging autoregression and diffusion for unified understanding and generation</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:49:23 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The rapid progress of large multimodal models has inspired efforts toward unified frameworks that couple understanding and generation. While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation.</description>

<title>Dr. Kernel: Reinforcement Learning Done Right for Triton Kernel Generations</title>

<guid>title:dr kernel reinforcement learning done right for triton kernel generations</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:01:09 +0000</pubDate>
<description>High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO.</description>

<title>ALIEN: Analytic Latent Watermarking for Controllable Generation</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.06101</link>
<guid>title:alien analytic latent watermarking for controllable generation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:04:27 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Watermarking is a technical alternative to safeguarding intellectual property and reducing misuse. Existing methods focus on optimizing watermarked latent variables to balance watermark robustness and fidelity, as Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are considered a powerful tool for generative tasks. However, reliance on computationally intensive heuristic optimization for iterative signal refinement results in high training overhead and local optima entrapment. To address these issues, we propose an \underline{A}na\underline{l}ytical Watermark\underline{i}ng Framework for Controllabl\underline{e} Generatio\underline{n} (ALIEN). We develop the first analytical derivation of the time-dependent modulation coefficient that guides the diffusion of watermark residuals to achieve controllable watermark embedding pattern. Experimental results show that ALIEN-Q outperforms the state-of-the-art by 33.</description>

<title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Management of Structured Parallel Farm Skeletons on Serverless Platforms</title>

<guid>title:reinforcement learning based dynamic management of structured parallel farm skeletons on serverless platforms</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 09:57:30 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We present a framework for dynamic management of structured parallel processing skeletons on serverless platforms. Our goal is to bring HPC-like performance and resilience to serverless and continuum environments while preserving the programmability benefits of skeletons. As a first step, we focus on the well known Farm pattern and its implementation on the open-source OpenFaaS platform, treating autoscaling of the worker pool as a QoS-aware resource management problem. The framework couples a reusable farm template with a Gymnasium-based monitoring and control layer that exposes queue, timing, and QoS metrics to both reactive and learning-based controllers. We investigate the effectiveness of AI-driven dynamic scaling for managing the farm's degree of parallelism via the scalability of serverless functions on OpenFaaS. In particular, we discuss the autoscaling model and its training, and evaluate two reinforcement learning (RL) policies against a baseline of reactive management derived from a simple farm performance model.</description>

<title>Can Vision Replace Text in Working Memory? Evidence from Spatial n-Back in Vision-Language Models</title>

<guid>title:can vision replace text in working memory evidence from spatial n back in vision language models</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:25:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Working memory is a central component of intelligent behavior, providing a dynamic workspace for maintaining and updating task-relevant information. Recent work has used n-back tasks to probe working-memory-like behavior in large language models, but it is unclear whether the same probe elicits comparable computations when information is carried in a visual rather than textual code in vision-language models. We evaluate Qwen2. 5 and Qwen2. 5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision.</description>

<title>Benchmarking Affordance Generalization with BusyBox</title>

<guid>title:benchmarking affordance generalization with busybox</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 08:31:27 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been attracting the attention of researchers and practitioners thanks to their promise of generalization. Although single-task policies still offer competitive performance, VLAs are increasingly able to handle commands and environments unseen in their training set. While generalization in vision and language space is undoubtedly important for robust versatile behaviors, a key meta-skill VLAs need to possess is affordance generalization -- the ability to manipulate new objects with familiar physical features. In this work, we present BusyBox, a physical benchmark for systematic semi-automatic evaluation of VLAs' affordance generalization. BusyBox consists of 6 modules with switches, sliders, wires, buttons, a display, and a dial. The modules can be swapped and rotated to create a multitude of BusyBox variations with different visual appearances but the same set of affordances.</description>

<title>Cross-Lingual Empirical Evaluation of Large Language Models for Arabic Medical Tasks</title>

<guid>title:cross lingual empirical evaluation of large language models for arabic medical tasks</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 06:52:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used in medical applications, such as clinical decision support, medical education, and medical question answering. Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness.</description>

<title>Mechanisms of AI Protein Folding in ESMFold</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.06020</link>
<guid>title:mechanisms of ai protein folding in esmfold</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:54:54 +0000</pubDate>
<description>How do protein structure prediction models fold proteins? We investigate this question by tracing how ESMFold folds a beta hairpin, a prevalent structural motif. Through counterfactual interventions on model latents, we identify two computational stages in the folding trunk. In the first stage, early blocks initialize pairwise biochemical signals: residue identities and associated biochemical features such as charge flow from sequence representations into pairwise representations. In the second stage, late blocks develop pairwise spatial features: distance and contact information accumulate in the pairwise representation. We demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying structural decisions of ESMFold can be localized, traced through interpretable representations, and manipulated with strong causal effects.</description>

<guid>title:persona generators generating diverse synthetic personas at scale</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:59:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Evaluating AI systems that interact with humans requires understanding their behavior across diverse user populations, but collecting representative human data is often expensive or infeasible, particularly for novel technologies or hypothetical future scenarios. Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes.</description>

<title>MatGPTQ: Accurate and Efficient Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.03537</link>
<guid>title:matgptq accurate and efficient post training matryoshka quantization</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:52:18 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant) is a recent quantization approach showing that a single integer-quantized model can be served across multiple precisions, by slicing the most significant bits (MSB) at inference time. This enables a single checkpoint to cover a wide range of memory and latency budgets, but renders quantization much more challenging. In particular, the initial MatQuant relies on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) variants, rather than fast one-shot post training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source and kernel support. We address all of these limitations by introducing Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization (MatGPTQ), a new PTQ pipeline that produces a single parent model jointly optimized for multiple target precisions in one-shot, based on a small calibration set. MatGPTQ casts Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, resulting in an algorithm that produces a multi-bit-width, &quot;sliceable&quot; model in a single pass. We also incorporate a new budget-aware search for heterogeneous per-layer bit-witdhs and provide efficient kernels that implement slicing and mixed-precision execution.</description>

<guid>title:symbol aware reasoning with masked discrete diffusion for handwritten mathematical expression recognition</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:46:49 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) requires reasoning over diverse symbols and 2D structural layouts, yet autoregressive models struggle with exposure bias and syntactic inconsistency. We present a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates HMER as iterative symbolic refinement instead of sequential generation. Through multi-step remasking, the proposal progressively refines both symbols and structural relations, removing causal dependencies and improving structural consistency. A symbol-aware tokenization and Random-Masking Mutual Learning further enhance syntactic alignment and robustness to handwriting diversity. On the MathWriting benchmark, the proposal achieves 5. 56\% CER and 60.</description>

<description>Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders (APD), also known as Parkinson-plus syndrome, are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In the early stages, overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs.</description>

<title>SDFP: Speculative Decoding with FIT-Pruned Models for Training-Free and Plug-and-Play LLM Acceleration</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.05499</link>
<guid>title:sdfp speculative decoding with fit pruned models for training free and plug and play llm acceleration</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:02:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction.</description>

<guid>title:day ahead electricity price forecasting for volatile markets using foundation models with regularization strategy</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 08:20:50 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e. g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored.</description>

<pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 22:08:41 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The exploration of unknown, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments by an autonomous communication-aware and collaborative group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) presents significant challenges in coordination, perception, and decentralized decision-making. This paper implements Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these challenges in a 2D indoor environment, using high-fidelity game-engine simulations (Godot) and continuous action spaces. Policy training aims to achieve emergent collaborative behaviours and decision-making under uncertainty using Network-Distributed Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ND-POMDPs). Each UAV is equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and can share data (sensor measurements and a local occupancy map) with neighbouring agents. Inter-agent communication constraints include limited range, bandwidth and latency. Extensive ablation studies evaluated MARL training paradigms, reward function, communication system, neural network (NN) architecture, memory mechanisms, and POMDP formulations.</description>

<description>The academia and industry are characterized by a reciprocal shaping and dynamic feedback mechanism. Despite distinct institutional logics, they have adapted closely in collaborative publishing and talent mobility, demonstrating tension between institutional divergence and intensive collaboration. Existing studies on their knowledge proximity mainly rely on macro indicators such as the number of collaborative papers or patents, lacking an analysis of knowledge units in the literature. This has led to an insufficient grasp of fine-grained knowledge proximity between industry and academia, potentially undermining collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency. To remedy the limitation, this study quantifies the trajectory of academia-industry co-evolution through fine-grained entities and semantic space. In the entity measurement part, we extract fine-grained knowledge entities via pre-trained models, measure sequence overlaps using cosine similarity, and analyze topological features through complex network analysis.</description>

<title>SpectraKAN: Conditioning Spectral Operators</title>

<description>Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.</description>

<description>Modern data centers (DCs) hosting artificial intelligence (AI)-dedicated devices operate at high power densities with rapidly varying workloads, making minute-level adaptation essential for safe and energy-efficient operation. However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i. e.</description>

<title>Quantization-Aware Regularizers for Deep Neural Networks Compression</title>

<guid>title:quantization aware regularizers for deep neural networks compression</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:07:43 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Deep Neural Networks reached state-of-the-art performance across numerous domains, but this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large and over-parameterized models, posing serious challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. As a result, model compression has become essential, and -- among compression techniques -- weight quantization is largely used and particularly effective, yet it typically introduces a non-negligible accuracy drop. However, it is usually applied to already trained models, without influencing how the parameter space is explored during the learning phase. In contrast, we introduce per-layer regularization terms that drive weights to naturally form clusters during training, integrating quantization awareness directly into the optimization process. This reduces the accuracy loss typically associated with quantization methods while preserving their compression potential. Furthermore, in our framework quantization representatives become network parameters, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to embed quantization parameters directly into the backpropagation procedure.</description>

<title>Characterizing Human Semantic Navigation in Concept Production as Trajectories in Embedding Space</title>

<guid>title:characterizing human semantic navigation in concept production as trajectories in embedding space</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:23:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods.</description>

<title>Evaluating the impact of word embeddings on similarity scoring in practical information retrieval</title>

<description>Search behaviour is characterised using synonymy and polysemy as users often want to search information based on meaning. Semantic representation strategies represent a move towards richer associative connections that can adequately capture this complex usage of language. Vector Space Modelling (VSM) and neural word embeddings play a crucial role in modern machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines. Embeddings use distributional semantics to represent words, sentences, paragraphs or entire documents as vectors in high dimensional spaces. This can be leveraged by Information Retrieval (IR) systems to exploit the semantic relatedness between queries and answers. This paper evaluates an alternative approach to measuring query statement similarity that moves away from the common similarity measure of centroids of neural word embeddings.</description>

<title>Semantic Self-Distillation for Language Model Uncertainty</title>

<guid>title:semantic self distillation for language model uncertainty</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:03:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large language models present challenges for principled uncertainty quantification, in part due to their complexity and the diversity of their outputs. Semantic dispersion, or the variance in the meaning of sampled answers, has been proposed as a useful proxy for model uncertainty, but the associated computational cost prohibits its use in latency-critical applications. We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection. We term this technique Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD), which we suggest provides a general framework for distilling predictive uncertainty in complex output spaces beyond language.</description>

<title>LocateEdit-Bench: A Benchmark for Instruction-Based Editing Localization</title>

<description>Recent advancements in image editing have enabled highly controllable and semantically-aware alteration of visual content, posing unprecedented challenges to manipulation localization. However, existing AI-generated forgery localization methods primarily focus on inpainting-based manipulations, making them ineffective against the latest instruction-based editing paradigms. To bridge this critical gap, we propose LocateEdit-Bench, a large-scale dataset comprising $231$K edited images, designed specifically to benchmark localization methods against instruction-driven image editing. Our dataset incorporates four cutting-edge editing models and covers three common edit types. We conduct a detailed analysis of the dataset and develop two multi-metric evaluation protocols to assess existing localization methods. Our work establishes a foundation to keep pace with the evolving landscape of image editing, thereby facilitating the development of effective methods for future forgery localization.</description>

<title>Depth-Wise Emergence of Prediction-Centric Geometry in Large Language Models</title>

<guid>title:depth wise emergence of prediction centric geometry in large language models</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:00:16 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We show that decoder-only large language models exhibit a depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases of computation accompanied by a reorganization of representational geometry. Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.</description>

<title>Rethinking Music Captioning with Music Metadata LLMs</title>

<guid>title:rethinking music captioning with music metadata llms</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:42:01 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Music captioning, or the task of generating a natural language description of music, is useful for both music understanding and controllable music generation. Training captioning models, however, typically requires high-quality music caption data which is scarce compared to metadata (e. g. , genre, mood, etc. ). As a result, it is common to use large language models (LLMs) to synthesize captions from metadata to generate training data for captioning models, though this process imposes a fixed stylization and entangles factual information with natural language style.</description>
