<title>Zooming without Zooming: Region-to-Image Distillation for Fine-Grained Multimodal Perception</title>

<guid>title:zooming without zooming region to image distillation for fine grained multimodal perception</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 12:00:35 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent &quot;Thinking-with-Images&quot; methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves &quot;single-glance&quot; fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional &quot;zooming gap&quot;.</description>

<title>STVG-R1: Incentivizing Instance-Level Reasoning and Grounding in Videos via Reinforcement Learning</title>

<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:53:32 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In vision-language models (VLMs), misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates often induces hallucinations. This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID.</description>

<title>Meta-Sel: Efficient Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Supervised Meta-Learning</title>

<guid>title:meta sel efficient demonstration selection for in context learning via supervised meta learning</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:11:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Demonstration selection is a practical bottleneck in in-context learning (ICL): under a tight prompt budget, accuracy can change substantially depending on which few-shot examples are included, yet selection must remain cheap enough to run per query over large candidate pools. We propose Meta-Sel, a lightweight supervised meta-learning approach for intent classification that learns a fast, interpretable scoring function for (candidate, query) pairs from labeled training data. Meta-Sel constructs a meta-dataset by sampling pairs from the training split and using class agreement as supervision, then trains a calibrated logistic regressor on two inexpensive meta-features: TF--IDF cosine similarity and a length-compatibility ratio. At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights. Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs.</description>

<title>Evaluating Few-Shot Temporal Reasoning of LLMs for Human Activity Prediction in Smart Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11176</link>

<pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 11176v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Anticipating human activities and their durations is essential in applications such as smart-home automation, simulation-based architectural and urban design, activity-based transportation system simulation, and human-robot collaboration, where adaptive systems must respond to human activities. Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt.</description>

<description>As AI usage becomes more prevalent in social contexts, understanding agent-user interaction is critical to designing systems that improve both individual and group outcomes. We present an online behavioral experiment (N = 243) in which participants play three multi-turn bargaining games in groups of three. Each game, presented in randomized order, grants \textit{access to} a single LLM assistance modality: proactive recommendations from an \textit{Advisor}, reactive feedback from a \textit{Coach}, or autonomous execution by a \textit{Delegate}; all modalities are powered by an underlying LLM that achieves superhuman performance in an all-agent environment. On each turn, participants privately decide whether to act manually or use the AI modality available in that game. Despite preferring the \textit{Advisor} modality, participants achieve the highest mean individual gains with the \textit{Delegate}, demonstrating a preference-performance misalignment. Moreover, delegation generates positive externalities; even non-adopting users in \textit{access-to-delegate} treatment groups benefit by receiving higher-quality offers.</description>

<title>AdaptEvolve: Improving Efficiency of Evolutionary AI Agents through Adaptive Model Selection</title>

<guid>title:adaptevolve improving efficiency of evolutionary ai agents through adaptive model selection</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 13:26:56 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Evolutionary agentic systems intensify the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning capability by repeatedly invoking large language models (LLMs) during inference. This setting raises a central question: how can an agent dynamically select an LLM that is sufficiently capable for the current generation step while remaining computationally efficient? While model cascades offer a practical mechanism for balancing this trade-off, existing routing strategies typically rely on static heuristics or external controllers and do not explicitly account for model uncertainty. We introduce AdaptEvolve: Adaptive LLM Selection for Multi-LLM Evolutionary Refinement within an evolutionary sequential refinement framework that leverages intrinsic generation confidence to estimate real-time solvability. Empirical results show that confidence-driven selection yields a favourable Pareto frontier, reducing total inference cost by an average of 37. 9% across benchmarks while retaining 97.</description>

<title>JEPA-VLA: Video Predictive Embedding is Needed for VLA Models</title>

<guid>title:jepa vla video predictive embedding is needed for vla models</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 11:20:43 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i. e. , anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution.</description>

<title>Agentic Test-Time Scaling for WebAgents</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.12276</link>
<guid>title:agentic test time scaling for webagents</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 18:58:30 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions.</description>

<title>Think like a Scientist: Physics-guided LLM Agent for Equation Discovery</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.12259</link>
<guid>title:think like a scientist physics guided llm agent for equation discovery</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 18:49:27 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.</description>

<title>STAR : Bridging Statistical and Agentic Reasoning for Large Model Performance Prediction</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.12143</link>
<guid>title:star bridging statistical and agentic reasoning for large model performance prediction</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:30:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.</description>

<title>RELATE: A Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced LLM Framework for Advertising Text Generation</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11780</link>
<guid>title:relate a reinforcement learning enhanced llm framework for advertising text generation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 10:00:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality. To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.</description>

<title>Code2Worlds: Empowering Coding LLMs for 4D World Generation</title>

<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:34:28 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code.</description>

<guid>title:adapting vision language models for e commerce understanding at scale</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:59:22 +0000</pubDate>
<description>E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.</description>

<title>Thinking with Drafting: Optical Decompression via Logical Reconstruction</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.11731</link>
<guid>title:thinking with drafting optical decompression via logical reconstruction</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:54:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Existing multimodal large language models have achieved high-fidelity visual perception and exploratory visual generation. However, a precision paradox persists in complex reasoning tasks: optical perception systems transcribe symbols without capturing logical topology, while pixel-based generative models produce visual artifacts lacking mathematical exactness. To bridge this gap, we propose that reasoning over visual inputs be reconceptualized as optical decompression-the process of reconstructing latent logical structures from compressed visual tokens. Guided by the axiom that Parsing is Reasoning, we introduce Thinking with Drafting (TwD), which utilizes a minimalist Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as a grounding intermediate representation. Unlike standard approaches that hallucinate answers directly, TwD forces the model to draft its mental model into executable code, rendering deterministic visual proofs for self-verification. To validate this, we present VisAlg, a visual algebra benchmark.</description>

<title>The Observer Effect in World Models: Invasive Adaptation Corrupts Latent Physics</title>

<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 17:56:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Determining whether neural models internalize physical laws as world models, rather than exploiting statistical shortcuts, remains challenging, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e. g. , fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis.</description>

<title>Convex Markov Games and Beyond: New Proof of Existence, Characterization and Learning Algorithms for Nash Equilibria</title>

<guid>title:convex markov games and beyond new proof of existence characterization and learning algorithms for nash equilibria</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 17:11:20 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Convex Markov Games (cMGs) were recently introduced as a broad class of multi-agent learning problems that generalize Markov games to settings where strategic agents optimize general utilities beyond additive rewards. While cMGs expand the modeling frontier, their theoretical foundations, particularly the structure of Nash equilibria (NE) and guarantees for learning algorithms, are not yet well understood. In this work, we address these gaps for an extension of cMGs, which we term General Utility Markov Games (GUMGs), capturing new applications requiring coupling between agents' occupancy measures. We prove that in GUMGs, Nash equilibria coincide with the fixed points of projected pseudo-gradient dynamics (i. e. , first-order stationary points), enabled by a novel agent-wise gradient domination property.</description>

<title>A Large Language Model for Disaster Structural Reconnaissance Summarization</title>

<guid>title:a large language model for disaster structural reconnaissance summarization</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:14:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an effective approach for monitoring and assessing structural condition by analyzing image and video data. By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process.</description>

<guid>title:seq2seq2seq lossless data compression via discrete latent transformers and reinforcement learning</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:30:55 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format.</description>

<title>Learning beyond Teacher: Generalized On-Policy Distillation with Reward Extrapolation</title>

<guid>title:learning beyond teacher generalized on policy distillation with reward extrapolation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:14:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i. e. , reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings.</description>

<description>The emergence of reasoning-based LLMs leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference introduces new serving challenges, as their extended reasoning phases delay user-visible output and inflate Time-To-First-Token (TTFT). Existing LLM serving frameworks fail to distinguish between reasoning and answering phases, leading to performance degradation under GPU memory constraints. We present PASCAL, a phase-aware scheduling algorithm that prioritizes reasoning to reduce TTFT while using controlled preemption and token pacing during answering to preserve Quality-of-Experience (QoE). Our hierarchical scheduler combines instance-level placement with intra-instance execution and enables dynamic migration at phase boundaries to balance load and reduce interference. Across benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, PASCAL reduces tail TTFT by up to 72% while maintaining answering phase SLO attainment, demonstrating the importance of phase-aware scheduling for reasoning-based LLM deployment.</description>

<guid>title:can local vision language models improve activity recognition over vision transformers case study on newborn resuscitation</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 14:31:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is essential for quality improvement and adherence to clinical guidelines, yet remains underutilized in practice. Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13. 26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).</description>

<title>TAVAE: A VAE with Adaptable Priors Explains Contextual Modulation in the Visual Cortex</title>

<guid>title:tavae a vae with adaptable priors explains contextual modulation in the visual cortex</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 13:50:56 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The brain interprets visual information through learned regularities, a computation formalized as probabilistic inference under a prior. The visual cortex establishes priors for this inference, some delivered through established top-down connections that inform low-level cortices about statistics represented at higher levels in the cortical hierarchy. While evidence shows that adaptation leads to priors reflecting the structure of natural images, it remains unclear whether similar priors can be flexibly acquired when learning a specific task. To investigate this, we built a generative model of V1 optimized for a simple discrimination task and analyzed it together with large-scale recordings from mice performing an analogous task. In line with recent approaches, we assumed that neuronal activity in V1 corresponds to latent posteriors in the generative model, enabling investigation of task-related priors in neuronal responses. To obtain a flexible test bed, we extended the VAE formalism so that a task can be acquired efficiently by reusing previously learned representations.</description>

<title>LLM-based Triplet Extraction from Financial Reports</title>

<guid>title:llm based triplet extraction from financial reports</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 12:36:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Corporate financial reports are a valuable source of structured knowledge for Knowledge Graph construction, but the lack of annotated ground truth in this domain makes evaluation difficult. We present a semi-automated pipeline for Subject-Predicate-Object triplet extraction that uses ontology-driven proxy metrics, specifically Ontology Conformance and Faithfulness, instead of ground-truth-based evaluation. We compare a static, manually engineered ontology against a fully automated, document-specific ontology induction approach across different LLMs and two corporate annual reports. The automatically induced ontology achieves 100% schema conformance in all configurations, eliminating the ontology drift observed with the manual approach. We also propose a hybrid verification strategy that combines regex matching with an LLM-as-a-judge check, reducing apparent subject hallucination rates from 65. 2% to 1.</description>

<title>Cross-Architecture Model Diffing with Crosscoders: Unsupervised Discovery of Differences Between LLMs</title>

<guid>title:cross architecture model diffing with crosscoders unsupervised discovery of differences between llms</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:53:25 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.</description>

<title>SpiralFormer: Looped Transformers Can Learn Hierarchical Dependencies via Multi-Resolution Recursion</title>

<guid>title:spiralformer looped transformers can learn hierarchical dependencies via multi resolution recursion</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:23:21 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Recursive (looped) Transformers decouple computational depth from parameter depth by repeatedly applying shared layers, providing an explicit architectural primitive for iterative refinement and latent reasoning. However, early looped Transformers often underperform non-recursive baselines of equal compute. While recent literature has introduced more effective recursion mechanisms to mitigate this gap, existing architectures still operate at a fixed, full-token resolution, neglecting the potential efficiency of computing over compressed latent representations. In this paper, we propose SpiralFormer, a looped Transformer that executes recurrence under a multi-resolution recursion schedule. We provide probing evidence that multi-resolution recursion enables the model to learn hierarchical dependencies by inducing iteration-wise functional specialization across different scales. Empirically, SpiralFormer achieves better parameter and compute efficiency than both looped and non-looped baselines across model scales from 160M to 1.</description>

<title>Self-Supervised Learning via Flow-Guided Neural Operator on Time-Series Data</title>

<guid>title:self supervised learning via flow guided neural operator on time series data</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 18:54:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for learning from unlabeled time-series data. However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data.</description>

<title>SToRM: Supervised Token Reduction for Multi-modal LLMs toward efficient end-to-end autonomous driving</title>

<guid>title:storm supervised token reduction for multi modal llms toward efficient end to end autonomous driving</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 07:21:24 +0000</pubDate>
<description>In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens. To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM).</description>

<title>GR-Diffusion: 3D Gaussian Representation Meets Diffusion in Whole-Body PET Reconstruction</title>

<guid>title:gr diffusion 3d gaussian representation meets diffusion in whole body pet reconstruction</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 07:10:38 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a critical challenge in molecular imaging, often hampered by noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference.</description>

<title>WaveFormer: Wavelet Embedding Transformer for Biomedical Signals</title>

<guid>title:waveformer wavelet embedding transformer for biomedical signals</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 17:20:43 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Biomedical signal classification presents unique challenges due to long sequences, complex temporal dynamics, and multi-scale frequency patterns that are poorly captured by standard transformer architectures. We propose WaveFormer, a transformer architecture that integrates wavelet decomposition at two critical stages: embedding construction, where multi-channel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) extracts frequency features to create tokens containing both time-domain and frequency-domain information, and positional encoding, where Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE) adapts position embeddings to signal-specific temporal structure through mono-channel DWT analysis. We evaluate WaveFormer on eight diverse datasets spanning human activity recognition and brain signal analysis, with sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 3000 timesteps and channel counts from 1 to 144. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFormer achieves competitive performance through comprehensive frequency-aware processing. Our approach provides a principled framework for incorporating frequency-domain knowledge into transformer-based time series classification.</description>

<guid>title:on the adoption of ai coding agents in open source android and ios development</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:30:29 +0000</pubDate>
<description>AI coding agents are increasingly contributing to software development, yet their impact on mobile development has received little empirical attention. In this paper, we present the first category-level empirical study of agent-generated code in open-source mobile app projects. We analyzed PR acceptance behaviors across mobile platforms, agents, and task categories using 2,901 AI-authored pull requests (PRs) in 193 verified Android and iOS open-source GitHub repositories in the AIDev dataset. We find that Android projects have received 2x more AI-authored PRs and have achieved higher PR acceptance rate (71%) than iOS (63%), with significant agent-level variation on Android. Across task categories, PRs with routine tasks (feature, fix, and ui) achieve the highest acceptance, while structural changes like refactor and build achieve lower success and longer resolution times. Furthermore, our evolution analysis shows improvement in PR resolution time on Android through mid-2025 before it declined again.</description>
