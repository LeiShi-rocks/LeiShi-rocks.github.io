<title>Learning to Retrieve Navigable Candidates for Efficient Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>

<guid>title:learning to retrieve navigable candidates for efficient vision and language navigation</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 17:00:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding.</description>

<title>Differences in Typological Alignment in Language Models' Treatment of Differential Argument Marking</title>

<guid>title:differences in typological alignment in language models treatment of differential argument marking</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:56:34 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Recent work has shown that language models (LMs) trained on synthetic corpora can exhibit typological preferences that resemble cross-linguistic regularities in human languages, particularly for syntactic phenomena such as word order. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to differential argument marking (DAM), a semantic licensing system in which morphological marking depends on semantic prominence. Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects.</description>

<title>3D Scene Rendering with Multimodal Gaussian Splatting</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.17124</link>
<guid>title:3d scene rendering with multimodal gaussian splatting</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 06:49:53 +0000</pubDate>
<description>3D scene reconstruction and rendering are core tasks in computer vision, with applications spanning industrial monitoring, robotics, and autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.</description>

<title>Understanding the Fine-Grained Knowledge Capabilities of Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17871</link>
<guid>arxiv:2602.17871</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>arXiv:2602. 17871v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress across a wide range of visual question answering benchmarks, spanning visual reasoning, document understanding, and multimodal dialogue. These improvements are evident in a wide range of VLMs built on a variety of base models, alignment architectures, and training data. However, recent works show that these models trail behind in traditional image classification benchmarks, which test fine-grained visual knowledge. We test a large number of recent VLMs on fine-grained classification benchmarks and identify potential factors in the disconnect between fine-grained knowledge and other vision benchmarks. Through a series of ablation experiments, we find that using a better LLM improves all benchmark scores equally, while a better vision encoder disproportionately improves fine-grained classification performance.</description>

<title>What Language is This? Ask Your Tokenizer</title>

<guid>title:what language is this ask your tokenizer</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:58:39 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Language Identification (LID) is an important component of many multilingual natural language processing pipelines, where it facilitates corpus curation, training data analysis, and cross-lingual evaluation of large language models. Despite near-perfect performance on high-resource languages, existing systems remain brittle in low-resource and closely related language settings. We introduce UniLID, a simple and efficient LID method based on the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm, leveraging its probabilistic framing, parameter estimation technique and inference strategy. In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification.</description>

<title>Beyond Static Pipelines: Learning Dynamic Workflows for Text-to-SQL</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.15564</link>
<guid>title:beyond static pipelines learning dynamic workflows for text to sql</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 13:24:56 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Text-to-SQL has recently achieved impressive progress, yet remains difficult to apply effectively in real-world scenarios. This gap stems from the reliance on single static workflows, fundamentally limiting scalability to out-of-distribution and long-tail scenarios. Instead of requiring users to select suitable methods through extensive experimentation, we attempt to enable systems to adaptively construct workflows at inference time. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that optimal dynamic policies consistently outperform the best static workflow, with performance gains fundamentally driven by heterogeneity across candidate workflows. Motivated by this, we propose SquRL, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' reasoning capability in adaptive workflow construction. We design a rule-based reward function and introduce two effective training mechanisms: dynamic actor masking to encourage broader exploration, and pseudo rewards to improve training efficiency.</description>

<title>One-step Language Modeling via Continuous Denoising</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.16813</link>
<guid>title:one step language modeling via continuous denoising</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 19:23:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Language models based on discrete diffusion have attracted widespread interest for their potential to provide faster generation than autoregressive models. In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation.</description>

<title>Scaling Open Discrete Audio Foundation Models with Interleaved Semantic, Acoustic, and Text Tokens</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.16687</link>
<guid>title:scaling open discrete audio foundation models with interleaved semantic acoustic and text tokens</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 18:32:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Current audio language models are predominantly text-first, either extending pre-trained text LLM backbones or relying on semantic-only audio tokens, limiting general audio modeling. This paper presents a systematic empirical study of native audio foundation models that apply next-token prediction to audio at scale, jointly modeling semantic content, acoustic details, and text to support both general audio generation and cross-modal capabilities. We provide comprehensive empirical insights for building such models: (1) We systematically investigate design choices -- data sources, text mixture ratios, and token composition -- establishing a validated training recipe. (2) We conduct the first scaling law study for discrete audio models via IsoFLOP analysis on 64 models spanning $3{\times}10^{18}$ to $3{\times}10^{20}$ FLOPs, finding that optimal data grows 1. 6$\times$ faster than optimal model size. (3) We apply these lessons to train SODA (Scaling Open Discrete Audio), a suite of models from 135M to 4B parameters on 500B tokens, comparing against our scaling predictions and existing models.</description>

<title>When More Experts Hurt: Underfitting in Multi-Expert Learning to Defer</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.17144</link>
<guid>title:when more experts hurt underfitting in multi expert learning to defer</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 07:45:18 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Learning to Defer (L2D) enables a classifier to abstain from predictions and defer to an expert, and has recently been extended to multi-expert settings. In this work, we show that multi-expert L2D is fundamentally more challenging than the single-expert case. With multiple experts, the classifier's underfitting becomes inherent, which seriously degrades prediction performance, whereas in the single-expert setting it arises only under specific conditions. We theoretically reveal that this stems from an intrinsic expert identifiability issue: learning which expert to trust from a diverse pool, a problem absent in the single-expert case and renders existing underfitting remedies failed. To tackle this issue, we propose PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert), a surrogate-based method that adaptively identifies a reliable expert based on empirical evidence. PiCCE effectively reduces multi-expert L2D to a single-expert-like learning problem, thereby resolving multi expert underfitting.</description>

<title>Discrete Stochastic Localization for Non-autoregressive Generation</title>

<guid>title:discrete stochastic localization for non autoregressive generation</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 04:05:40 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation reduces decoding latency by predicting many tokens in parallel, but iterative refinement often suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift under self-generated drafts. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e. g. , ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling. We propose \textsc{DSL} (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer.</description>

<title>Can Generative Artificial Intelligence Survive Data Contamination? Theoretical Guarantees under Contaminated Recursive Training</title>

<guid>title:can generative artificial intelligence survive data contamination theoretical guarantees under contaminated recursive training</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 22:38:18 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator.</description>

<title>MARLEM: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Simulation Framework for Implicit Cooperation in Decentralized Local Energy Markets</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.16063</link>
<guid>title:marlem a multi agent reinforcement learning simulation framework for implicit cooperation in decentralized local energy markets</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 22:22:45 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This paper introduces a novel, open-source MARL simulation framework for studying implicit cooperation in LEMs, modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and implemented as a Gymnasium environment for MARL. Our framework features a modular market platform with plug-and-play clearing mechanisms, physically constrained agent models (including battery storage), a realistic grid network, and a comprehensive analytics suite to evaluate emergent coordination. The main contribution is a novel method to foster implicit cooperation, where agents' observations and rewards are enhanced with system-level key performance indicators to enable them to independently learn strategies that benefit the entire system and aim for collectively beneficial outcomes without explicit communication. Through representative case studies (available in a dedicated GitHub repository in https://github. com/salazarna/marlem, we show the framework's ability to analyze how different market configurations (such as varying storage deployment) impact system performance. This illustrates its potential to facilitate emergent coordination, improve market efficiency, and strengthen grid stability.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 21:58:17 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Background: Large language models have demonstrated strong performance on general medical examinations, but subspecialty clinical reasoning remains challenging due to rapidly evolving guidelines and nuanced evidence hierarchies. Methods: We evaluated January Mirror, an evidence-grounded clinical reasoning system, against frontier LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-5. 2, Gemini-3-Pro) on a 120-question endocrinology board-style examination. Mirror integrates a curated endocrinology and cardiometabolic evidence corpus with a structured reasoning architecture to generate evidence-linked outputs. Mirror operated under a closed-evidence constraint without external retrieval. Comparator LLMs had real-time web access to guidelines and primary literature.</description>

<description>Capability emergence during neural network training remains mechanistically opaque. We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2. 8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e. g. , modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME $\approx$ 2.</description>

<title>TopoFlow: Physics-guided Neural Networks for high-resolution air quality prediction</title>

<guid>title:topoflow physics guided neural networks for high resolution air quality prediction</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 19:38:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We propose TopoFlow (Topography-aware pollutant Flow learning), a physics-guided neural network for efficient, high-resolution air quality prediction. To explicitly embed physical processes into the learning framework, we identify two critical factors governing pollutant dynamics: topography and wind direction. Complex terrain can channel, block, and trap pollutants, while wind acts as a primary driver of their transport and dispersion. Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2. 5 RMSE of 9.</description>

<guid>title:non contact physiological monitoring in pediatric intensive care units via adaptive masking and self supervised learning</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 19:34:50 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Continuous monitoring of vital signs in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) is essential for early detection of clinical deterioration and effective clinical decision-making. However, contact-based sensors such as pulse oximeters may cause skin irritation, increase infection risk, and lead to patient discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data. We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.</description>

<title>Fluid-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.14559</link>
<guid>title:fluid agent reinforcement learning</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 08:37:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The primary focus of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been to study interactions among a fixed number of agents embedded in an environment. However, in the real world, the number of agents is neither fixed nor known a priori. Moreover, an agent can decide to create other agents (for example, a cell may divide, or a company may spin off a division). In this paper, we propose a framework that allows agents to create other agents; we call this a fluid-agent environment. We present game-theoretic solution concepts for fluid-agent games and empirically evaluate the performance of several MARL algorithms within this framework. Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings.</description>

<title>CEPAE: Conditional Entropy-Penalized Autoencoders for Time Series Counterfactuals</title>

<guid>title:cepae conditional entropy penalized autoencoders for time series counterfactuals</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 12:49:44 +0000</pubDate>
<description>The ability to accurately perform counterfactual inference on time series is crucial for decision-making in fields like finance, healthcare, and marketing, as it allows us to understand the impact of events or treatments on outcomes over time. In this paper, we introduce a new counterfactual inference approach tailored to time series data impacted by market events, which is motivated by an industrial application. Utilizing the abduction-action-prediction procedure and the Structural Causal Model framework, we first adapt methods based on variational autoencoders and adversarial autoencoders, both previously used in counterfactual literature although not in time series settings. Then, we present the Conditional Entropy-Penalized Autoencoder (CEPAE), a novel autoencoder-based approach for counterfactual inference, which employs an entropy penalization loss over the latent space to encourage disentangled data representations. We validate our approach both theoretically and experimentally on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, showing that CEPAE generally outperforms the other approaches in the evaluated metrics.</description>

<title>Effective and Robust Multimodal Medical Image Analysis</title>

<guid>title:effective and robust multimodal medical image analysis</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 04:23:46 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multimodal Fusion Learning (MFL), leveraging disparate data from various imaging modalities (e. g. , MRI, CT, SPECT), has shown great potential for addressing medical problems such as skin cancer and brain tumor prediction. However, existing MFL methods face three key limitations: a) they often specialize in specific modalities, and overlook effective shared complementary information across diverse modalities, hence limiting their generalizability for multi-disease analysis; b) they rely on computationally expensive models, restricting their applicability in resource-limited settings; and c) they lack robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising reliability in medical AI applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-Attention Integration Learning (MAIL) network, incorporating two key components: a) an efficient residual learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific multi-scale patterns and b) an efficient multimodal cross-attention module for learning enriched complementary shared representations across diverse modalities. Furthermore, to ensure adversarial robustness, we extend MAIL network to design Robust-MAIL by incorporating random projection filters and modulated attention noise.</description>

<description>Robots executing iterative tasks in complex, uncertain environments require control strategies that balance robustness, safety, and high performance. This paper introduces a safe information-theoretic learning model predictive control (SIT-LMPC) algorithm for iterative tasks. Specifically, we design an iterative control framework based on an information-theoretic model predictive control algorithm to address a constrained infinite-horizon optimal control problem for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems. An adaptive penalty method is developed to ensure safety while balancing optimality. Trajectories from previous iterations are utilized to learn a value function using normalizing flows, which enables richer uncertainty modeling compared to Gaussian priors. SIT-LMPC is designed for highly parallel execution on graphics processing units, allowing efficient real-time optimization.</description>

<description>Causal inference, a critical tool for informing business decisions, traditionally relies heavily on structured data. However, in many real-world scenarios, such data can be incomplete or unavailable. This paper presents a framework that leverages transformer-based language models to perform causal inference using unstructured text. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by comparing causal estimates derived from unstructured text against those obtained from structured data across population, group, and individual levels. Our findings show consistent results between the two approaches, validating the potential of unstructured text in causal inference tasks. Our approach extends the applicability of causal inference methods to scenarios where only textual data is available, enabling data-driven business decision-making when structured tabular data is scarce.</description>

<title>A Rational Analysis of the Effects of Sycophantic AI</title>

<guid>title:a rational analysis of the effects of sycophantic ai</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 18:49:19 +0000</pubDate>
<description>People increasingly use large language models (LLMs) to explore ideas, gather information, and make sense of the world. In these interactions, they encounter agents that are overly agreeable. We argue that this sycophancy poses a unique epistemic risk to how individuals come to see the world: unlike hallucinations that introduce falsehoods, sycophancy distorts reality by returning responses that are biased to reinforce existing beliefs. We provide a rational analysis of this phenomenon, showing that when a Bayesian agent is provided with data that are sampled based on a current hypothesis the agent becomes increasingly confident about that hypothesis but does not make any progress towards the truth. We test this prediction using a modified Wason 2-4-6 rule discovery task where participants (N=557) interacted with AI agents providing different types of feedback. Unmodified LLM behavior suppressed discovery and inflated confidence comparably to explicitly sycophantic prompting.</description>

<title>High-Fidelity Network Management for Federated AI-as-a-Service: Cross-Domain Orchestration</title>

<guid>title:high fidelity network management for federated ai as a service cross domain orchestration</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 00:40:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>To support the emergence of AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS), communication service providers (CSPs) are on the verge of a radical transformation-from pure connectivity providers to AIaaS a managed network service (control-and-orchestration plane that exposes AI models). In this model, the CSP is responsible not only for transport/communications, but also for intent-to-model resolution and joint network-compute orchestration, i. e. , reliable and timely end-to-end delivery. The resulting end-to-end AIaaS service thus becomes governed by communications impairments (delay, loss) and inference impairments (latency, error). A central open problem is an operational AIaaS control-and-orchestration framework that enforces high fidelity, particularly under multi-domain federation.</description>

<title>Knowing When Not to Answer: Abstention-Aware Scientific Reasoning</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.14189</link>
<guid>title:knowing when not to answer abstention aware scientific reasoning</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 15:29:43 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Large language models are increasingly used to answer and verify scientific claims, yet existing evaluations typically assume that a model must always produce a definitive answer. In scientific settings, however, unsupported or uncertain conclusions can be more harmful than abstaining. We study this problem through an abstention-aware verification framework that decomposes scientific claims into minimal conditions, audits each condition against available evidence using natural language inference (NLI), and selectively decides whether to support, refute, or abstain. We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error.</description>

<title>Image Generation with a Sphere Encoder</title>

<guid>title:image generation with a sphere encoder</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 18:59:57 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We introduce the Sphere Encoder, an efficient generative framework capable of producing images in a single forward pass and competing with many-step diffusion models using fewer than five steps. Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost. Project page is available at https://sphere-encoder.</description>

<title>A Curious Class of Adpositional Multiword Expressions in Korean</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.16023</link>
<guid>title:a curious class of adpositional multiword expressions in korean</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 21:23:16 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Multiword expressions (MWEs) have been widely studied in cross-lingual annotation frameworks such as PARSEME. However, Korean MWEs remain underrepresented in these efforts. In particular, Korean multiword adpositions lack systematic analysis, annotated resources, and integration into existing multilingual frameworks. In this paper, we study a class of Korean functional multiword expressions: postpositional verb-based constructions (PVCs). Using data from Korean Wikipedia, we survey and analyze several PVC expressions and contrast them with non-MWEs and light verb constructions (LVCs) with similar structure. Building on this analysis, we propose annotation guidelines designed to support future work in Korean multiword adpositions and facilitate alignment with cross-lingual frameworks.</description>

<title>The Impact of Formations on Football Matches Using Double Machine Learning. Is it worth parking the bus?</title>

<guid>title:the impact of formations on football matches using double machine learning is it worth parking the bus</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 19:51:42 +0000</pubDate>
<description>This study addresses a central tactical dilemma for football coaches: whether to employ a defensive strategy, colloquially known as &quot;parking the bus&quot;, or a more offensive one. Using an advanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework, this project provides a robust and interpretable tool to estimate the causal impact of different formations on key match outcomes such as goal difference, possession, corners, and disciplinary actions. Leveraging a dataset of over 22,000 matches from top European leagues, formations were categorized into six representative types based on tactical structure and expert consultation. A major methodological contribution lies in the adaptation of DML to handle categorical treatments, specifically formation combinations, through a novel matrix-based residualization process, allowing for a detailed estimation of formation-versus-formation effects that can inform a coach's tactical decision-making. Results show that while offensive formations like 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 offer modest statistical advantages in possession and corners, their impact on goals is limited. Furthermore, no evidence supports the idea that defensive formations, commonly associated with parking the bus, increase a team's winning potential.</description>

<title>Intent Laundering: AI Safety Datasets Are Not What They Seem</title>

<guid>title:intent laundering ai safety datasets are not what they seem</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:29:22 +0000</pubDate>
<description>We systematically evaluate the quality of widely used AI safety datasets from two perspectives: in isolation and in practice. In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on &quot;triggering cues&quot;: words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce &quot;intent laundering&quot;: a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues.</description>

<title>Latency-aware Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning for Semantic Communications</title>
<link>https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2602.15640</link>
<guid>title:latency aware human in the loop reinforcement learning for semantic communications</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 15:07:41 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Semantic communication promises task-aligned transmission but must reconcile semantic fidelity with stringent latency guarantees in immersive and safety-critical services. This paper introduces a time-constrained human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (TC-HITL-RL) framework that embeds human feedback, semantic utility, and latency control within a semantic-aware Open radio access network (RAN) architecture. We formulate semantic adaptation driven by human feedback as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) whose state captures semantic quality, human preferences, queue slack, and channel dynamics, and solve it via a primal--dual proximal policy optimization algorithm with action shielding and latency-aware reward shaping. The resulting policy preserves PPO-level semantic rewards while tightening the variability of both air-interface and near-real-time RAN intelligent controller processing budgets. Simulations over point-to-multipoint links with heterogeneous deadlines show that TC-HITL-RL consistently meets per-user timing constraints, outperforms baseline schedulers in reward, and stabilizes resource consumption, providing a practical blueprint for latency-aware semantic adaptation.</description>

<title>OmniVTON++: Training-Free Universal Virtual Try-On with Principal Pose Guidance</title>

<guid>title:omnivton training free universal virtual try on with principal pose guidance</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 08:27:43 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) concerns the synthesis of realistic person imagery through garment re-rendering under human pose and body constraints. In practice, however, existing approaches are typically optimized for specific data conditions, making their deployment reliant on retraining and limiting their generalization as a unified solution. We present OmniVTON++, a training-free VTON framework designed for universal applicability. It addresses the intertwined challenges of garment alignment, human structural coherence, and boundary continuity by coordinating Structured Garment Morphing for correspondence-driven garment adaptation, Principal Pose Guidance for step-wise structural regulation during diffusion sampling, and Continuous Boundary Stitching for boundary-aware refinement, forming a cohesive pipeline without task-specific retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse generalization settings, including cross-dataset and cross-garment-type evaluations, while reliably operating across scenarios and diffusion backbones within a single formulation. In addition to single-garment, single-human cases, the framework supports multi-garment, multi-human, and anime character virtual try-on, expanding the scope of virtual try-on applications.</description>
